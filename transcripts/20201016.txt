So today's update will be brief since we just had our all hands call last Wednesday. However, I do want to put a teaser out there that we have a new and exciting segment for you in today's update that you won't want to miss.

So in our time together, we're going to Cover 4 main things. One general business updates to a campus recruiting update, which I'm quite excited about. Weekly wins weekly Impact, so let's dive in together.

We'll start with general business updates. As you heard on the all hands call on Wednesday from JB and Sarah, the firms in a really good spot. Just as we go deeper into the fourth quarter, October looks to be another incredibly strong month. We've improved November significantly week by week, and December is trending up nicely as well. So given that the partner team is really thinking about Q1 as well, and how do we really maintain the momentum and the tailwinds that we have in the business right now to get off to a strong start now to help us with that, we also ask that you start thinking about Q1 as well, specifically starting to kind of think about it.

And identifying close work that can start after the new year. So let's talk about campus recruiting. Next, we've had just a very strong year on campus. We know that the campus recruiting season, specifically the months of September and October, are just an incredibly taxing and heavy lift on the firm. So I just want to start by thanking our campus teams for all the work that you do, the blood sweat tears that we put into this. The work that you do truly is the lifeblood of the firm. As we look to identify an ad great early career students off campus.

So to give you some of the data, we've had a 75% acceptance rate from our summer 2020 interns. This is particularly interesting because as you remember, we had a typical internship this summer, in which several interns chose not to join us for the unpaid internship, but rather those that did converted an many who did not participate in our internship program this summer accepted the full-time offer with us.

So as you think about kind of our by 21 goals, the goals are 92 full time hires, 41 intern specifically, we've extended 140 offers thus far across our campuses and have had 39 acceptances. So still early innings. But but the results are strong so far. What were equally as excited about this year? It's not just the numbers themselves, but the diversity of talent that we're bringing in off campus as well as the diversity of campuses themselves. So we continue to see strong performance at just.

Anchor schools like Texas, A&MUT and Baylor, but we also are seeing new campuses come online like Duke, Notre Dame Emory and the University of Central Florida, who had allegedly still want BAMMA by the way. And Lastly, I'm personally really excited about our focus on HBC colleges like preview and M, so I'm excited to announce also that we have our first HPC campus hire joining the firm this year as well our acceptance rates. If you look at the data or above their historical averages.

In which we really attribute that to kind of two things. One is just the work that you all do, and the strong engine that we have in place, but secondarily just the overall health of the firm relative to the to the declining health of several of our competitors, resulting in really less office pressure on campus. So said differently, I feel blast. Hopefully you all's well that that our firm is significantly outperforming our peers in the consulting industry, and that we're able to reap those benefits off campus.

So now let's talk about sales.

We had another strong week this past week. We closed about 2.5 million with wins at clients like First Financial Bank, Chili's, Southwest Airlines, Mars Valley leadership.

Ann Ketchum, which is a PR agency inside Omnicom. So shadoan a shout out to loot wrong on that one. For those of you that run the call Wednesday, lose our newest partner and he's officially on the scoreboard now. We had two big wins last week at SL or an Leslie pools, so this continued sales momentum week over week over week just adds significant tailwind to our business, which is, which is in turn improved our Q4 health and put us in a really good position as we head into 2021. So well done. Great job everyone.

Next, let's talk about the Weekly Impact award.

So shoutout goes to the Leslie Pools teams from Andrew Stewart. So specifically Felix Guyardo, Gilbert Sharp, Carter Payson, Michael Grube. This team did an awesome job.

Successfully delivering a four week DNA strategy project and really winning over the client through that, there was a few curveballs and late nights. But the team's perseverance and kind of relentless pursuit to excellence really drove the project quality and ultimately the wind that I just mentioned as a result of this strategy project and us converting a larger following phase work. So great job everyone, we're thankful for each one of you.

Now, as I kind of teased a little bit, we have a new segment this week that we're really excited about and excited to announce so.

To continue to be good stewards of the firm's financial resources and quite frankly, given the increased production cost of these high quality videos that the partner team produces every week, we've been able to secure some client budget through commercial advertisements. So to start, we're super grateful for our relationship with Eli Lilly and their generous donation for this week's commercial.

Hey cordera Vincent here, really excited to be joining you today to talk in this brand new segment about one of our clients, Eli Lilly.

To fundamentally shift the way drugs are developed, designed, and ultimately delivered to people. To that end, we've actually looked at clarity to all of your emails. All of your chats, all of your phone calls, the like we've parsed it through natural language processing, machine learning, artificial intelligent computer vision, the likes to find a really interesting problem. As you know, with current virus, we've all just been staring at monitors nonstop for months on end now, and we saw through the data that these weekly updates in particular are very difficult for you.

They find that people find them incredibly boring and routine. If you feel that way, don't worry, you're not alone. Many of us actually struggled with these incredibly repetitive updates with consultative jargon such as synergies and right sizing. And with the help of Tema, sell the new drug that we've developed in partnership with Eli Lilly. All of that pain is going to disappear. Teams will actually worked with your adrenal system to help you stay focused and alert in the same way that a bear chasing you through the forest fires up that system. The compounds and team is still there, clinically proven.

To be more effective than the next leading medication. So stop wait start enjoying what I'm going to do now is reduce some of the legal stuff that I have to, but in awhile that's playing here in the background. I'm going to show you the directions to actually get to be part of the phase three trial for this drug. It's already past Phase one safety phase, two efficacy. We're now in stage three and you could area to have a unique opportunity to do that. Just the text. The number here on the screen in one second is going to pop up that number. There we have a new system I've been told by the indirect team they're working on it still. It's a little buggy.

So if you don't get a response right away, please just keep texting it over and over and over again. I know it's annoying, but it actually helps us with the robustness with the scalability etc. Turn it with that aside, really excited to be sharing this with you. Feel free to text the number if you're interested to learn more about it. If you want to sign up for the trial, you want more information. Shooting phone number right here?
