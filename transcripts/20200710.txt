Hey Cordera family happy Friday to you. This would be a really quick update this week.

Business is extremely healthy right now. July's in a great spot. From utilization and revenue standpoint without had quite a few wins this week. Coming off the 4th of July holiday really got a lot of things closed and going, so some of those Brinker a couple of different wins at the HomeAdvisor suite of companies. Amgen new win at SL Org, so back out there extensions at JB Hunt and C Spire. Both of those. Those teams are just killing it right now and then, uh?

You win with Mars as well, so great work on all those Anna really active sales pipeline and business development pipeline right now. Also so super healthy across the business you've heard me mentioned, we're beginning to really start hiring at what I just call normal pace again. So not not in a real throttled or conservative way. But get back just more normal crew. Dear hiring. So excited to be doing that. Make sure if you have strong referrals that you get those to our talent acquisition team.

And if you're in the if you're some of our interviewers that you're making yourself available to do those so we can get some more great people into the company.

Update on the acquisition front of the London firm. That's still all going fine, but it is completely outside of our control from a timing standpoint. Ours and theirs, so we still love the deal. They're still excited about the deal, no concerns that we won't get it done. The timing is out of our control though, which if you had to start making a list of any of my strengths that I might have, that patience is not on that list. And so that's a little challenging for me. But we're working our way through that, and it'll it'll ultimately get to a great outcome hopefully next week.

You know impact. I want to celebrate Marissa Matthews and the C Spire team that specifically working on the digital beta be experience there. She had a great note that GAIL then forwarded to me.

From the it's the CEO's son, but he's in charge of this new business unit in this engagement and a great note there about just the impact that that team is having on their business and how well we're helping them be successful on that engagement. So just another great example at one of our longstanding clients of why there had been a client for more than 10 years, and it's because of the work that Marissa and really the broader team have done over the years and continue to do to serve them and help them be successful in their business.

Wanna make remind you if you have people you want to celebrate for that you can send emails to impact at critera.com and will make sure and recognize the folks that are doing a great job and impacting each other's teammates. And then our clients as well.

Last last couple of points here. So we have. We have had a little spike in covid cases within Credera and so I just want to encourage everyone to really be as safe and smart as you can be. Obviously you can't. You can't guarantee prevention from that sort of thing, but do be smart and know that, especially in Texas right now it's going around quite widespread and so be safe. Be smart, take care of yourself and that helps take care of other people too in this regard.

And then in addition to that and somewhat related to it, to this whole unusual season that we're in, we've got a number of folks who reported that they're having some mental health challenges right now, and I'm very grateful that they've let us know about that so that we can get them. Any help that we can provide an just so that we know that we need to be looking after them a bit, and so I would just encourage all of us to make sure we're checking in with ourselves and our peers.

And our teammates. And if you are having any sort of challenge like that, let Stephanie Miller and her team know so that we can point you to any resources or get you any help or whatever we can do to assist you through that. 'cause this is just an unusual season of life that we're all living with, and for some of us we feel it in different ways and so just just please do let us know about that.

Yeah, we've got our matching donation program still running to the Black Girls code and ends in two weeks. The matching piece, so make sure you email us your receipts of your contributions to contributions@credera.com so that we can make sure we count those for our matching donation that will match at the end. There I'll wrap up super proud to be doing this with you. Love what I get to do and thankful for all of you in your efforts and hope everyone has a great weekend and will have another good week next week.

Thanks.
