Hey Cordair family happy Friday to you. I hope everyone is having a good week. I know we're pretty busy across the whole firm right now with a lot of client delivery, high utilization, CPM calibration and all that going on and a lot of new business as well. But thank you for all of your efforts, just kind of pretty quick update today. June is shaping up. We're about to wrap that up. Obviously early next week to be a really great month for us in July as well. We need there's a few more things we need to close to really get July and just right position, but it's in.

Good spot where we know it's going to be a pretty good month as well.

Kind of bigger news on the London based acquisition that we've shared information about over the past several months, so we are very very very close on that deal and could close as early as next week sometime. There's one thing that's a bit out of our control from a timing standpoint in terms of a tax ruling from the UK government that we have to get back before before we can actually close that. Otherwise we're really to the finish line on that and super excited about it. I've done 11 calls with some of their top clients this week.

And just exceptionally encouraging the feedback. You know, it's exactly what we want to hear for one in terms of, you know, trusted partner, trusted advisor, very strategic, but also not afraid to get in and get their hands dirty. Roll up their sleeves, whatever analogy and really help their clients with these bigger transformation. ULL programs really low ego approach to doing all that high confidence, low ego and so honestly, just the headline is it's the same things that our clients would say about us in terms of the people, the quality.

The way that they approach those relationships and the results that they helped to get and so really positive information across the board on that.

Let's see, so that's that big update had several big wins this week from two of our exceptionally important flywheel clients and supply wheels. Or obviously the clients that we've had for years that continue to our teams, do incredible work, and they bring us on to take on more and more and more challenges. So at NRG we got a big team extension last Friday and then at Angie's Home Services so Angieslist HomeAdvisor home starzan handy that family of companies.

There were there were four or five very very large wins this week that will do a lot to boost July and beyond as those get entered into the forecasting tool and begin to get work. So just real kudos to those two teams for continued commitment to your clients and just excellence and the impact that you're having on their businesses that continue to have them coming back to us for more work. That really is like the lifeblood of credera. So thank you for that.

There's also probably probably dozens, but at least there's there's six or so that I'll mention quite large new business opportunities with new clients that we're working through right now, and thank you to all of you who are participating in those. It's been a lot of work on that. I know the last few weeks for sure, so Walgreens is a huge opportunity that we're right in the middle of AT&T, Volkswagen, Samsung, Elsevier, Danone, just to name a handful that I happen to have insight into and grab the details of.

But those are really big, interesting, exciting opportunities. Until let's continue to push, those forward will provide updates in the subsequent weeks, hopefully with good news.

Wanted to share that as a follow up to our announcement from a couple of weeks ago that we would be giving a matching donation to whatever you all choose to give to that is meant to benefit anti racism or fighting racism an an otherwise benefiting under represented minorities and based on the recommendations from the Diversity Inclusion Committee who did a great job looking at some different options and analyzing that we have selected black girls code.

As our organization that will give our matching.

Are matching donation two? Again, you can send in your receipt so you can give to whatever organization you want that fits that theme and send it into contributions@credera.com and then will match that when we get to the end of. I believe we said eight weeks and so go ahead and make that donation send us your receipt and then we'll make our matching contribution to that. There will be more information in my email about that organization.

From an award standpoint this week, want to recognize Cameron Wiener? We got an incredible email sent to us from the Managing Director of Sparks and Honey. Cameron's been working with them over the past several months and his work with them quite a bit over the overtime and I'm just going to read a bit of this. But you know, just just said, OK, I want to drop you a note and let you know what a major contribution camera is made on our business over the past couple of months.

It's been a vital part of the Q business Q as their main platform, not just helping organize what we do, but being a huge strategic contributor as well. He's essentially been my right hand pushing the teams thinking and setting us up for success. He's an amazing talent as I'm sure you will know and we do know that. And thank you Cameron. An incredible job really is. It's so great to get that kind of email and really appreciate the work you're doing to make an impact on on our business. And on there's got wasp on my ear that's going to be funny for everyone, I'm sure.

You know last thing I want to wrap up with is just.

You know with the Black Girls Code Ann, and really a lot of our clients. I just want to emphasize 'cause I think we lose sight of this sometimes the impact that we're able to have on the world and on the Community communities we live in. We're not just helping clients to better their business, that's part of it, certainly. But many of these things they enable people that have jobs. They help our healthcare clients and pharmaceutical clients reach patients better, faster, stronger, and ultimately just really help with large portions of the economy.

And keeping people gainfully employed, and so I just want us to all. Keep that in mind sometimes as we go through, especially seasons of life like right now.

Important to remind ourselves the impact that we are making into really everyday. Buckle down and go try to do what we can to help in those different ways. And so I just want to put the top of everyone's mind will continue to look for ways to kind of highlight those those wins as it relates to impacts on the world and impact on our communities. But anyway, I'm thankful for everything that you all are doing. Thankful for the opportunity to get to lead here and hope everyone has a great weekend and will talk to you next week. Thank you.
