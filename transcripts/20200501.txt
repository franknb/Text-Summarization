Thank you, dear family. Happy Friday to you know, Flava Flav cameo appearance this week, just pretty quick update. Pretty straight forward. So first as some parts of the country began to loosen the restrictions that they have next week will provide more information on what our plans are associated with reopening, but we do since we're able to work from home efficiently and effectively. We do plan to continue working largely the way that we are right now until at least the end of June.

It will probably more information on that, just a couple of things to make sure you understand the guiding principles that will follow is primarily to be make sure that we're taking care of everyone's health and safety and welfare, both mental and physical, safety and health. Their second that there will likely need to be a lot of individual flex flexibility as we begin to return working in various forms and fashions overtime and just ask that you continue to honor your local guidelines as it relates to your non work activities and to make sure you stay safe there.

Second update is really just some of you may have heard the Omnicom earnings call earlier this week or read. Some of the shareholder updates and letters so let's give it a quick quick update on that, so in general. The earnings call was was largely fairly straightforward and not a lot of drama, which I think is actually a really good sign. Omnicom definitely appears to be healthier than our holding company competitors and so Q One came in.

A bit ahead of what analysts expected. Q2 is expected to be a rough quarter, but then you know, and not a lot of guidance given for the back half of the year. But in general, kind of confident message that they believe the appropriate measures have been taken and that there have been really impressed with the individual agencies innovation ability to continue working well with clients in the shareholder letter CRITERA specifically was called out, and so I want to mention that so it says code error has helped us forge stronger relationships and partnerships.

With the C-Suite of our multinational clients, we have continued to invest in their growth since the acquisition and open new offices, and so again that's another good sign we're getting called out specifically there in a positive light.

When we were on Thursday, so yesterday we had an opportunity to present at an Omnicom level. It's called DD fuel. So business development, fuel type of a presentation that they have every other week and they had four slots and this one Thursday and Cordero was represented in three out of those four. So try it. Was there with Omnicom Health and the Criteria Health initiative Jay Carter from a innovation offering standpoint. And then I was there. Presenting are participating in our DTC 360, our direct to consumer offering.

So it was really cool that we had that much speaker time, but also probably more impressively when the other agencies were talking. They talked about Critera. So much and in such positive and flattering ways in terms of the quality of our people. The quality of the work the speed at which we can get things done and that's all just a complete testament to the work that you all are doing every day and the impact that you are having on the other agencies within Omnicom.

Taurus celebrate that from from our business update really third week in a row of positive momentum building. So good week there were now officially in May so welcome to may few wins that I'll call out that we've had in the last week. Cardinal Health Our Calling, which is a homeless care nonprofit. It's funded by Microsoft and AT&T. HBO, part of HBO Max, offering their Unilever Employbridge had an extension kind of broadening extension to our team.

And JB Hunt so really good momentum on the client front there. And then there's a number of. There's probably a dozen or so that I've got listed here, and there are obviously others, but high probability opportunities. So Omnicom Media Group and Automation opportunity, Angie's List, another opportunity at Unilever around Salesforce, Abilene Christian University, Brinker National Instruments, Samsung, Palo Alto Networks, additional JB Hunt opportunity, McDonald's Red Lobster Hopdoddy, and a big Novartis RFT that we're working on right now.

So a ton of good business development activity and I've just continue to be impressed and proud of the team with the.

Greatness of the work, as well as just the incredible collaboration from people in different offices. People in different practices all coming together to really bring what Cordero does best to bear for some of these proposals.

We, you know, just kind of looking backwards. Well, we're still counting up exactly how we finished in May. It'll be a little bit below are submitted plan, but All in all you know really positive month given the circumstances that we're all going through.

So it'll end up most likely slightly ahead of last April, so it's a pretty amazing that we've actually achieved little bit of growth. It'll be a small bit of growth, but year over year growth in this economic climate is in pretty impressive outcome. Lastly, just want to share two different stories of our people making huge impacts on their clients and each other, and ultimately communities we live and work in, but the energy team was specifically recognized by the President of Business Solutions Group from NRG that sent us a note saying credit has been a great partner, continued to create value, continued to.

Great value during this strange time and then he's very thankful that we were working on projects for his business special special. Call out to Erin Groetzinger, who's been leading that team for a couple of years now and he was specifically mentioned by the client as a massive contributor in Big Leader. Many other contributors from our team over the years and so big thank you to everyone who's been a part of that team. 2nd called I'll make is from Jenn and specifically she said for the Army team got great kudos this week from rap, about our tools and training team so they are absolutely killing it with their work on a few key program artifacts in clue.

Eating strategic Vision director, business and systems context diagram and a program road map. So Annie Brennan Jaquith and Matt has Zynga have really exemplified criteria superpowers this week. So great job team there to continue to submit your call outs to your colleagues about the impacts they're making. Just a reminder that we did set up an email inbox called impact@criteria.com and you can send those in and then we monitor that and can help make sure people were getting recognized for the impacts they're making. So just to wrap up.

Thank you for all the hard work. Thank you for the continued Grit, Hustle, determination that you're all demonstrating. Let's just keep trying to chip away and put stack good weeks together and kind of stay the course here so you know. Again, I've said this multiple times the last few weeks. This is making us stronger. I can see that strength emerging as a group as a company as a culture, and I'm thankful for you and thankful for what we're going to do right now. So have some have some fun this weekend. Get some rest and we'll see you next week, thanks.
