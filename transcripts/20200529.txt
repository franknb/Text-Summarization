Hey Credir family happy Friday to you. I hope you had a great short week here and enjoy the Memorial Day holiday. We had a great time out here, had some friends out to visit for the weekend.

Also welcome to new baby calf, to our herd so fun weekend at the farm, but then I really energizing break for me as well and happy to be back at it this week and we've had a really good week so this would be a quick update today from a business update standpoint at the month of May.

We're really at the end of it, with today being the last business day came in. It'll come in right about 7.1 million in revenue, which is just right at the RE forecasted plan that we put together and a great outcome given where we were, you know, eight weeks ago, quite frankly incredible outcome. June is ahead of plan from that standpoint and actually looks like it's going to be quite a strong month from a revenue and profitability and even growth standpoint. Again, it's really a byproduct of all of our grit. Hard work.

Determination and resiliency over the last 2 1/2 months and I just I couldn't be more proud of this team and thankful for all the work that's gone into that. We're in just a much, much, much better place than I could have ever imagined that we would be in. Given what has happened during that time frame and where we were at. Like I said 1812 weeks ago.

Thank thank you for all that and encouraged by where we continue to kind of trend in the back will be wrapping up the first half of the year there with the end of June and looks like we're going to be in really good position as we kind of head into the back half. Three noteworthy wins that I'll point out from this week. We had extensions and new work one at JB Hunt at Triumph Capital and then also at National Instruments. A big win that we got this week that I think is about 1.3 million in fees for critera, Kevin King and the team have been working on that incredible job.

And that's partnered with organic on that, but at 1.3 in cryptography, so big win and a great client that we're growing there an then I'm just going to run through and share some of the other noteworthy business development pursuits that we have underway. Right now there are quite a few of them, which is encouraging and a lot of these are really interesting projects. Works with project work with some very interesting and cool clients, so Interstate batteries, some digital marketing type opportunities there. There are past great Critter client from years ago, great see them. Come back on the scene.

An opportunity with the World Cup 2022 where we would be providing kind of program, leadership and governance type structure for that Walgreens big opportunity Walgreens that Jenn and Chicago team are really spearheading and doing a great job with the pursuit. Their opportunity with Volkswagen. That would be work that we would do from the US, but obviously German company and another great kind of expansion into Europe. Opportunity for us there to do enterprise architecture type work. Have a great opportunity with Samsung that Taylor Marley.

Originated an that we've been pursuing for the last couple of months, but we appear to be making some new traction there with their vendor management procurement. Engaging with us to get EM essays and NDA's and other things like that in place so positive signs their caliber. We've got a big opportunity with the global CMO of Unilever. That's a joint venture and partnership between US and Salesforce to go after that, Our Calling is a really great nonprofit that benefits and helps.

Homeless people to it's a joint venture between Microsoft and AT&T that has CEO level support from both of those organizations, and we expect to get that fully approved in the next couple of weeks to move forward. Multiple engagements with Angie's List and HomeAdvisor, it continues to be an incredibly important and productive client and that team are doing a remarkably good job of serving them and making an impact there, but also generating a lot of great revenue for our business echelon fitnesses sort of appellate unlike competitor that we've got an engagement.
