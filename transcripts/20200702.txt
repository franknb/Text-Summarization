Dear Family, happy Thursday and welcome to July. Want to give you just a quick update here will be off for the holiday tomorrow, but wanted to share a few things as we head into the holiday weekend. So from a business update standpoint finished up the month of June in great shape. Actually beat our forecast for that month in our plan for the month an that also puts us for Q2 slightly ahead of the what we call the 5 + 7 forecast that we did.

At the beginning of June and.

Really close to just about 1% off of what our original plan for the year was through the 1st six months of the year, which is absolutely remarkable given the situation we've been dealing with with with Cobra 19 specifically for the year about up about 13% year over year in terms of revenue and running at a very healthy profit margin as well and EBIT DA so tremendous performance. Thank you for everything that you're doing that impacts that in a positive way.

It really is. It's remarkable achievement an never would have guessed that we would have been able to do that back. If you ask back in mid March early April timeframe when we when we were right in the middle of justice, absolutely challenging business circumstances there. And so thank you for that.

The outlook for the back half of the year is really positive, and so because of that continued strong demand that we're seeing we are ramping back up our hiring and our talent acquisition efforts. We obviously have large group of campus hires who will be starting with us starting at the end of August and then late September in late October. Because of that, the hiring that we'll be doing here for the next few months will be focused mostly in kind of the mid levels of the company, so senior consultants, managers, architects, etc.

Focusing in that part of the hiring model. So if you have good recommendations and referrals, please send those to the talent acquisition team so that they can get those in and we can make sure we talk to those people but exciting to be doing that. Again, obviously we thought we slowed that down for a few months. Rightfully so, but good to be back to bringing great new people into the business and continuing to find the Great town a great culture fits that really are the fuel for the future.

Quick update on the London acquisition that we've been talking about for months and months, and that, I think in my update last week, I said could close this week. It will not. So we still everything going really well there, but we are still waiting back from to hear back from the UK tax authority on a specific ruling about how for some of their sellers, how their capital gains would be treated. We've everything is in great shape there, but we want to get that ruling back before we actually closed. So most likely that will happen next week. But it is a little bit out of everyone's control except the UK.

A tax authority, so we're in a bit of a waiting game there. Otherwise in good shape. Really productive week from a wins standpoint for new client. New but new business so I'll just read through a few of these. Loftis Ranch Lake Tream more at Home Advisor, University of Phoenix. More C Spire Exxon Mobil, Quorum business solutions in RG, an Alteryx so great mix there of some of our real go to anchor kind of flywheel clients as well as a couple of new clients in the mix.

Lot of good new business activity as well with big activity at HBO, AT&T, Volkswagen, Samsung, Walgreens just to mention a few of the kind of bigger, more well known kind of client logos there that are big opportunities as we you know just really bitter reflection here at the midway point of the year. So it's been a really honestly strange and intense here, you know, I think the word unprecedented is.

Pretty overused, but in this year it's it's accurate.

You know both with the global pandemic and then you know really racial injustice in the United States coming to ahead with the George Floyd murder an I just wanted to share. Like given all that, I'm just extremely proud of how Critera has risen to the occasion. And I mean that across a few different fronts. You know, I think it's been incredible to watch how you all and really the people with Cordera have cared for each other on a personal and professional level and really dug in with each other and made sure that.

First and foremost, we're healthy and safe and then secondarily, you know that we're maintaining a productive and collaborative work environment have been extremely encouraged by that the tremendous impact that we've had on a number of our different clients and their businesses, which impacts their people, and ultimately the further kind of the communities that they operate in. But you're seeing this massive separation of the companies that have invested and are investing in kind of digital enablement and digital transformation from those who have not.

And how much better those businesses that have invested or performing? And obviously, that's the place we, the space we play in, and so we're seeing our impact. Just kind of played out in real time. And I suspect that will only be heightened on into the future.

You know, I would say I'm really proud of how we've been leaning into some of the social issues of the world. An inappropriate way, meaning we're not turning into a political organization or something, but these are real human issues and we have to. We have to lean in and deal with those, and I've been very encouraged about how the people with criteria have done so in a very positive way, and we need to continue to do that.

And then you know, Lastly, you know just those things along with our continued geographic expansion, both organically. But then through acquisition, how well all that lines up with you know, sort of supporting and moving us forward with our vision of being a global boutique consulting firm that makes an oversized impact on our people on our clients, an on the communities that we live and work in. And you know those things. It's incredible to have done all that in a year where.

There are certainly headwinds. There's not been the easiest year to operate, but I think it's only made us stronger and I'm tremendously proud of what you all have done and what we've done together. And I think it's only going to make us better as we as we move forward the back after this year and into 2021. So again, just thank you for all the effort and the work into that. And honestly, just for the heart behind the people with criteria that's the most important thing wrap up there again, good up another good week. Another good update. I'm very, very thankful for all of you.

Hope you have a great 4th of July weekend and actually get some rest. Have some fun and will talk to you next week. Thank you.
