Hey queer family, happy Friday to you. Another great week here at Critera and so I'll share some quick updates today about how things are going. So from a business and financial perspective in the month of August is going to be a great month. We should come in ahead of our forecast and it looks like it's going to be an all time record month from a revenue and profitability standpoint for the USPS to business and the UK business is doing great as well. The DFW team so they're having a strong August and they're expecting.

September for them to be a great month. They had a lot of holiday vacation in the month of August, but they were expecting September to be really strong and they've got really healthy business forecast heading into the end of the year. So on all fronts in a good spot right now and with a great outlook. Looking forward, we've got a large class of new campus hires who will start on Monday of next week, so make sure like I mentioned last week that you're making them feel welcome.

Reaching out to them as well as you know, once they get through their criteria, you and on boarding and training that you're getting them staffed into your teams. That's really the best way to get them integrated into the firm into the culture and to Start learning and so, but always brings a ton of new energy and life and fun to the business. When we have our new campus hires start, so we're excited to welcome them. Some wins this week that I'll mention. So we won new business or extensions at C Spire, NRG Orthofix Kidder Mathews.

Genentech and Eastman Chemicals so very well done to all those teams and all existing clients but continuing to expand and grow and extend our presence there wanted to share some praise from Peter Yobo about some people on his teams that are making a huge impact. So Ryan Chinen groups for the big contributions and heavy lift on critter.com continue to get really really positive feedback from the whole rebrand effort and the website and the new templates.

It's been as far as I can tell, universally praised by our clients and just other friends of mine who have given feedback. Also, David Johnson and Jeff Cry Zach for their leadership in terms of weekly activities that are helping keep the practice engaged and and have some fun throughout the whole kovid season they've been doing that, Jeff, I must have just missed my invite to those fun events. I don't know what happened, but must must have been my oversight I'm sure. And Alan Jung for going above and beyond on every client.

And just doing an amazing job adding a ton of value is what Peter mentioned that Alan's been doing. So Alan great, great work and thank you for that.

Couple couple last things and we'll wrap up so one is just a.

A preview a heads up that I am going to start asking some of the other partners to give these weekly updates occasionally so I'll still do a fair share of them, but give you a chance to hear from some of the other partners. Get to know them a bit and for them to share their point of view on how the business is going so we will start to see some of that starting in September and then last bit here before we wrap is wanted to share just something that's really encouraging. So John John Wren, who's Omnicom CEO?

Reached out to me in early July, Ann wanted to set up time to talk about critter's growth and expansion planning going forward, and specifically he's been observing. You know, in the two years that we've been part of Omnicom, the incredible impact and really outsized impact that we've made on Omnicom and some of their other clients, and just how well our businesses performed holistic Lee. But especially during this pandemic season that we're in.

And so he wanted to get together and look for ways to continue to invest in us to keep that momentum and build on that momentum. And so I would say for one, just in general that's encouraging. And I'm really proud that, you know, it's really a byproduct of the work that you all do everyday with each other and with our clients to make that impact. But it's also good because, you know, we've since had two meetings where I walked them through some materials that I worked with partner team to create.

To that really articulates kind of our strategy as we look forward and some of the areas that we believe investment would be helpful to us and those have since been been approved as of this past Monday, and so I just say, you know, like really encouraging position overall and there are some of those things will be more details as we get into our fiscal 21. Planning that will share in terms of specific investment areas. But you know, there's some things that will vary directly, benefit you in terms of additional learning and development.

Opportunities and budget. For that, we're going to invest in some upgrade of some of our systems and tools that we use that should make your life a little bit easier and us a bit more efficient on some of those things, as well as just continued investment in talent in both in talent acquisition and being able to go out and continue to hire the best people on the market. So so that we can continue to just build upon what we've got here. And so All in all, really exciting and encouraging update.

Um, really other. I'll wrap up here just by saying really, really proud to get to do this with you all think we've got just an extraordinary group of people here and an amazing firm and a bright future. And so I'm very thankful for you and very thankful for that. For that man, I hope you all have a great weekend and we'll see you next week.
