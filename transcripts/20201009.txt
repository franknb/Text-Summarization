Good morning crew. Dear family, this is Scott Covington. I'm one of the managing partners at Cordera Ann just wanted to give a weekly update and really excited about the progress of the firm, especially through the pandemic. An JB asked if I'd give an update this weeks, so also asked me to give a little bit of an introduction and so I'm really a management consulting practitioner. Started my career at Andersen Consulting, which became Accenture an have been a partner here at Cordera since 2012.

I actually collaborated with criteria on a large scale transformation project for Interstate batteries between 2009 and 2012, so really had a great opportunity to work with JB and Andrew Warden and Kevin King and Brian Plantis and Andrew Stewart and a whole bunch of other folks and just really fell in love with the people of Cardarine. So have been here ever since and really excited about the progress that we've made as it relates to adding offices, adding geographies really extending into Europe.

Has been a big vision that we've talked about probably for five years.

And so that's something that really, really proud of the DM W acquisition and spent a lot of time collaborating with the Strategy Investments Committee to really affect that and implement that and find that company. And so really, really thankful for Christine and and Simon and all the team over in the UK. Those guys were just doing an incredible job. Aneinu from the minute that we met the culture alignment was really strong. And so when we think about mergers and acquisitions, we're really talking about first and foremost.

Making sure that the culture connects, because that's really the essence of cardera is really the the people that care that we have for each other, and being able to find that honestly weeds out a tremendous number of companies. And so as we look ahead and we think about additional acquisitions or mergers or things like that and primarily acquisitions, is really what we're focused on. Those are going to first and foremost camp out on culture, and so we're looking at about 170 companies.

And we'll sift through those. And probably you know it'll it'll take some time, but we are seeing some interesting things, and we're looking specifically in some geographies like the West Coast in the United States, and in other parts of Europe. So think Germany think Sweden think you know Paris. Think just extending the capabilities in Europe is an idea, but will never sacrifice the cultural dynamics.

And obviously the financial components are critical as well, so I don't want to under under play that, but just the priority is first and foremost on the on the cultural connection. So I've got a few things that I'm reading from a screen, so I apologize. There's a lot of notes and things that Daniel Holes provides for these updates and really thankful for him in the role that that he plays in this so.

I want to just mention that obviously we had phenomenal month last month. We're headed towards a really great month this month. There's really nothing new to update you on with the financials. Will get more that as we get to the end of the at the end of the month, so some big wins this week at Home advisor. Toyota Connect Cardtronics Loftus Wildtype SCP distributors Essel or an in RG and so just really thankful for the teams that have collaborated and worked on those.

That's huge that we continue to win these great client projects and just really create some great opportunities for our people to really be able to sink their teeth into. From a career standpoint. And that's that's really. What gets us motivated in a lot of ways and then obviously doing super innovative work with our clients is just always fun. David Daube at asked to just for you guys to keep your eye out for an email that will come out later today about some changes and some important updates from the IT team.

And so hats off to Ryan Walker and team. Those guys are incredible. They certainly have helped me a time or two. I know how to hard drive, crash a few weeks ago and they got me back up and running with a new laptop in a matter of minutes. So very thankful.

Um, when we talk about some of the programs for criteria you and some of the ways that we can continue to sharpen the saw and learn and grow one of the great things that has come out recently. That Allison Kingsley has worked on and really in collaboration with Meredith Donel, they put together this first year consultant program and it's really aimed at helping new hires from campus get up to speed and fully integrated into the firm. And so those of you who are new hires, please look.

Lookout for the opportunity in the schedule. Invite for that. That will be a great opportunity and and you can work with your life season and other people to help you coordinate your schedule so that you're able to attend that. But we're really excited about that and the content and of that training will release it around the core. Values of humility, integrity, professionalism and excellence, and that's really the cornerstone of everything we do. And obviously building knowledge, capital and capabilities. On top of that.

And we're really excited about this. So be on the lookout.

From a from an, impacts and shout outs perspective and this is always just there's so many that we could cover every every week, which is a great challenge to have, but there's really some great things this week that I'll point out. Bria forward and this came from Scott Hensley. Really wanted to send a shout out for the impact that she's making it cavender's. She's going above and beyond in a complex client environment where we're making and managing third party system integrator deployments with poems.

WMS systems and I probably butchered some of that terminology, but pretty afford super thankful for you, and I've seen the great work you've done at Southwest on projects that we've collaborated on and really excited for you. So thank you Brendan Bailey, Hanne Falkenberg, and team that includes Daniel Schonberg, Mary seeing, Jeff Briggs. This is from Mixu shout out just for leading the delivery to automate the quote to cash process for ceasefires nonrecurring revenue. Lines of service.

Annemann ceasefires been a client of ours for so long an you know. Hats off to Galen team and Mikes. You and Jeff Briggs and everybody out there because you guys just continue to grow that client account and in ways that really provide great results for them. And I've interacted a time or two. Some of their leaders and they just seem like great people so it's great to be able to help them and expand their capabilities in the marketplace. And I saw Nick Saban on the sidelines with the.

The A&M game and I am an Aggie, by the way fighting Texas class of 90. Three whoops so those of you who are Aggies then you'll understand this but I saw Nick saving on the sideline the other day with that C Spire logo on the side of his his headset and I was telling the family about how that was. One of our clients and they were mildly amused, but I thought it was really cool.

So another shout out for Hannah Falkenberg and this is from Catherine brochure and it says Hanne Falkenberg has done an exceptional job of delivering the excellence at C Spire while juggling other high impact responsibilities during the campus recruiting season. An service simultaneously serving as the campus champion for UGA where she created an incredible events including Instagram takeover and for our Georgia candidates that was, that was something that was really just the work she's done is just above and beyond. And so we know that so many of you have dived into the.

The campus recruiting over the last several weeks Anhana an Andrew Warden and team and everybody who participates and I know so many have that so many more names than we could mention. Just super thankful and so I always encourage you to reach out at anytime. I'm always open to do a virtual coffee or to get to know yet if I haven't met you yet and just super thankful for the progress that the firm is making an you know we look forward to continuing to grow.

In ways that really provide those career opportunities that are meaningful, I remember early in my career there were partners who went out of their way to help me and so one of the greatest joys is to be able to do that at this point in the journey and believe it or not, you'll be at this point before you know it, and so it's just a great great day. So thank you all and I hope you have a great weekend. Make sure to schedule time off for the Holidays. They asked me to share this so we can plan an estimate for the.

You know, kind of as we get to the end of the year and things like that. But more importantly, so that you actually get to recharge your batteries and spend time with family and friends. That's just a huge important thing. We're not going to look back later in life and think we should have worked more hours, but will definitely look back and remember the fun memories of the teams we collaborated with in the family members that we made relationships with, and so just hope you all have a great weekend.
