Hey Cordera, happy Friday and the end to what has been a very very unusual week in the world and even impacting us here at Critera. Just this time a week ago was geared up for a fun spring break in Colorado. Skiing with my family we drove all the way up there only to find out all the resorts in Colorado had been shut down by the governor and so immediately turned and drove back. So definitely not the way we were hoping to spend the first few days of spring break but we've been making the best of it. Played a lot of games together as a family.

This week while we've been working from home up from our place in Oklahoma, plenty of arguments over who's winning those games. And so we're having to start tracking and keeping score carless right now. Saying that she is in fact winning, and that's very much in dispute, but so one of the big changes that impacts all of us here in areas we've obviously been working from home for this last week. And at this point, expect that to continue for an extended period of time beyond just next week. Haven't made an official decision on that yet.

That is what I'm anticipating and will get that announcement to you sometime next week.

Our primary concern as we go through all of this is that you know that your health and safety and so do you want to make sure you're taking really good care of yourself both physically and emotionally, and let us know how we can help you with that. In particular, as we work through this uncertain and stressful time that we're dealing with, you know, from a business standpoint in the near term, so March and Q1, we're in great shape and are actually going to finish that a little bit ahead of plan. That's what that looks like.

For March, that's that's great news, as we look a little further out into mid to late April and beyond is where we're beginning to see some of the impacts already on our business of coronavirus in the overall economic slowdown that's going on in the world specifically, we have seven or eight different clients who have started to pull back on their projects with us really based on their businesses being so heavily impacted by the by the virus and what's going on with that. And so we're continuing to monitor that.

On a daily basis, or really a real time basis. But we are anticipating that the next weeks and months will be quite challenging from a business standpoint. And So what the things that you can do to best contribute. Invest this help with that is to continue to pour into each other and help each other you know to stay connected to your fellow criterions, but then also really make sure that you're serving your clients with excellence. During this time they certainly need it like if we think about our purpose is really to go help these clients and impact their businesses in positive ways.

Never is that more important than right now. During this time of crisis, and so please make sure you're continuing to do that.

You know, even though in the times ahead would be be challenging, I'm very, very confident because I believe in prayer and specifically the people with critera that during this challenging time we'll all rally together and leverage our grid and creativity to come up with new ways to be successful to continue to help each other in times of need. And you know, there's all sorts of interesting and good and fun ways that I've heard about prettier people staying connected during this from virtual happy hours.

To you know, groups that are sharing different playlists and things like that just as a way to stay connected during an otherwise kind of trouble. Troubling time. An last point I'll make is that you know this this time will pass and you know these things happen and then they they. They end at some point and it's it during that time is when we need to even be stronger. Ek sitting then we were entering the way they do. That is really just by working closely together and will have this shared experience. Now that can be quite unifying and so I'm very optimistic about the future.

Panera, even though I know that the next weeks and months may be quite challenging and very thankful for the opportunity to work with all of you. For each of you and the chance to lead here and I'll talk to you next week.
