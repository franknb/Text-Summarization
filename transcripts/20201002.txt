Hiker dear family, I Amgen Cody Ann I have been at critera for 10 months now. I'm the managing partner in our Chicago office an I work with our team on the US Army. I focus on building up Chicago as one of our newer markets and I also work at the Omnicom level working on the dynamic customer experience offering. Today we're going to cover our usual business updates weekly wins. I'll give you a brief update of what's going on here in the Windy City.

Um, a little bit of a reminder and some encouragement for the upcoming Election Day off on 11 three. And then we're going to wrap it up with a bunch of impact shout outs. So first and foremost, we welcome 23 new people to the firm this week. So excited to have you all we've got in that group. 14 campus hires. 9 experience hires joining not just our consulting practices, but also some of our corporate teams as well. We're really glad you're here and we look forward to the time where we can meet you in person.

But for now, we're just really grateful to have you on board everybody. Please reach out to these folks, get to know them as they join your teams. Lend a hand, help them get up to speed, and make them feel as much a part of the family and the team as possible.

This is a little bit crazy, but that last group was higher.

Our class of 2020 cohort. We might have a few trickling in over the next couple of months, but that was really our last big batch. So crazy to think about. We've had 50 sharp knew Criterions. Join us over the past 60 days. We are so so so excited that you have chosen credera as the place to start your career.

Speaking of which.

Is a lot of you know we are in the throes of campus recruiting? I wanted to thank all of you for your hard work and the extra effort that it is taking to find great people and to help them find their way to credera. Please keep that up as we as we wrap up the recruiting season for the class of 2021. We really look forward to having students join us for both internships and full-time positions around this time next year.

Moving on to finances more great news. September just wrapped up and it was another record breaker. It was our first $9,000,000 month ever. An we didn't just stop at 9 million. We made it all the way to 9.2. So absolutely amazing to be apart of this growing organization and taking this company to new Heights, especially in a season where we experienced a few headwinds. I'm really, really proud of the work that we've done and I sing it.

On the rooftops. Every time I'm talking to somebody about the great work we're doing here, October little bit more of the same I'm afraid. Looks like we're going to be on track to have another record month, so fingers crossed, keep up the hard work. We really appreciate it. And I can't wait for somebody to share the numbers that we're going to pull in in October.

November and December looking super healthy as well. Please start thinking about not just planning your petio but getting it into replicon. We really want to make sure that everybody has some good downtime over the year end Holidays much much well deserved break. Needed all around I'm sure. And then Lastly, as you're continuing to do the great work with our clients and delivering excellent start thinking about you know are there places that we can help them more.

Right, how can we start filling the sales pipeline for Q1 in 2021? God, I can't believe we're talking about that already, but here we are.

And then also we had a bunch of wins this week that I wanted to share with you all. JB Hunt Wild type netsync Network Solutions Amgen first financial and several wins at SWA, which is really, really exciting. We had one extension and two new projects, one with the mobile team, one in data strategy. So super proud of the work that we're doing to help that client that has been really really hit by covid Ann.

And I think it's just a testament to the great work that we've done with them throughout the years that they continue to come back to us to help them solve their toughest challenges.

A little bit on Chicago. For those of you who might be wondering what's going on up here this week, we actually added three people to the team. Which brings us to a grand total of 18 people, which is staggering to think about. We started 2020 with three people on the books. We will be at 20 people by the end of October. As of right now, I expect that number might go up a little bit because we've been really recruiting hard and the town acquisition team has done a great job of filling the funnel with great candidates for us to talk to.

So I'm hoping fingers crossed that we end the year for 2020 somewhere around 25 people. We are also in the process of locking down to $7,000,000 task order for 2021 for the US Army. We're having great conversations with Nielsen about doing the same level of work with them for next year that we did in 2020 and Jason got an John Jacobs in the team audit. McDonald's continued to have great conversations with McDonald's as they're locking down their budgets for 2021.

And then last but not least, I know we talked a little bit about campus recruiting earlier, but I really wanted to to to send some shout outs from into our fellow criterions on the impact that they're making during this campus recruiting season.

Just some folks that have really gone above and beyond the Call of Duty. So first on this list is Jenna Swinney Ann. I think we should nickname Jana Jump in Jenna, because Jenna has jumped in at the last minute to cover five or six interviews that she was not originally scheduled for in the past couple of weeks. And when I say jump in literally 4 minutes, 3 minutes before the interview is supposed to start, Jana is raring to go smiling an putting our best foot forward with these campus.

Recruits um so thank you Jenna for being such a trooper and leaning in when we absolutely needed to. Also wanted to call out and give a shout out to Grace Leanne. The Baylor recruiting team. This is from Andrew Warden to put it lightly, the Baylor staff has raved about grace and the teams intentionality and personal touch. We had a virtual line out the door all day and gave students the best experience we possibly could have.

I also wanted to call out Hannah. Hannah is leading the charge this year for us. Coming in an really revamping the campus recruiting program. She's worked ungodly hours these past few weeks, but she consistently joins meetings on time. She's prepared, she's got a smile on her face. She's the Hannah that we have come to know and love.

And she really does go above and beyond to serve the people who are supporting the Krampus recruiting effort. And she is just personifying patience, competence and commitment. We are so lucky to have you. Thank you so much for leading us in this charge. And last but not least, I also wanted to call out a bunch of people who are really helping out with the new region based virtual campus teams, Devin.

And Hannah have been a powerful tag team. They are the reason that this new virtual regional based format has worked. They exemplify the core values they have been managing the team to get over whatever hurdles have come our way and they have put in more than their fair share of time and effort. So Devin leisure Hannah. So this car. Thank you so much for everything that you've done to really help us expand our horizons with the virtual program this year.

It is it means a ton and last but not least, I just wanted to thank each and everyone of you guys out there for all of the effort that you're making. We are having an extraordinary impact on our clients. We're having extraordinary impact on our communities and last but not least, we are having an extraordinary impact on one another. I know it's been a really, really interesting year. It's definitely not the first year that I expected coming into a new organization, but I can tell you.

It has been a wonderful ride an I'm so happy to be here so have a great weekend everybody. Get some rest and we will see you next week. Thank you.
