Hey Critera family happy Friday to you.
Wanted to start out this week talking a bit about the election that's been going on in the United States. Obviously a lot of just uncertainty and anxiety, and you know, I would imagine, regardless of how you voted, if you voted, we're all feeling a bit of anxiety and stress and frustration. Emotion on top of everything else that's already going on in our lives and in the year 2020, so I wanted.
For all of us to really practice good inclusive leadership, again, regardless of how you vote or how you believe or how you feel to be respectful of other people and also just appreciate that there are likely some of your colleagues. There are certainly some of your colleagues who, depending on how this all works out or gets sorted out over the next few weeks, are going to be happy with the outcome and others who are going to be very upset by the outcome and very very frustrated saddened by the outcome an.
Just be aware of that and show some good human empathy and care and compassion, and also realize that some of your colleagues are hurting and so do what you can to help those people and give them some space if they need some space and some time you got a WhatsApp thread with some of my closest friends from college, there's about 12 of us on it and normally it's like college football banter. But last month it's been heavy political debate where of the 12 of us fairly?
Evenly distributed across the spectrum of political point of view, and so we've been having a pretty heated, healthy debate. And it's been it's been quite nice because it's been always kind of backed by. We can be honest with each other. We respect each other and we come back to that. You know, we don't let it stay sort of sideways for very long and started coming back to an appreciation that we live in a country where we can have different points of view. And we're a friend group that can have points at different points of view and still respect and love each other. At the end of all that.
You have had some other conversations recently with neighborhood people in other things where I didn't leave those feeling the same way. I left him feeling very frustrated because I didn't feel like there was good sort of respect for other points of view beyond what the other individual or individuals may have had. And so my encouragement on this note is for one practice good inclusive leadership. And what I would call good leadership overall and realize there were a diverse country. We have a lot of different points of views and opinions, that's
part of what makes us a great country. We're also a resilient country, and so even though I expect the next several weeks to be really bumpy as we get the actual results sorted out and agreed upon and all that.
We will get through all this and everything will be OK and I fundamentally believe that and so hang in there. I do think it'll be bumpy for another three weeks or a month, but it'll all be alright ultimately.
So that's that piece that I just wanted to share. And if you know like I told the partner team, if you're struggling with something like that and need a little time to step away and make sure you get it because it is important, this is a difficult season that we're all working through terms of just normal business updates. Our business continues to be in really good shape and really healthy, so October we didn't quite hit the $10,000,000 target that we mentioned a couple weeks ago and thought we were going to get to. We were really, really close. We were finished up at about 9.8.
And a half so close to round up to 9.9. Still in all time, record month. Outstanding month very profitable month November and December look great and are starting to shape or really nicely heading into January in Q1. So from a business standpoint really in a nice spot in good shape. Do want to remind everyone. Please schedule and plan to take PT. Oh in November and December you know it's been a long hard year and want to make sure everyone gets a chance to recharge, reconnect when and if you're able.
Be able to get with your family and friends and spend some time with them as well. Over the Holidays there. There's several wins that I wanted to feature this week. Unilever in RG Angie's List and then we closed $4,000,000 of new business, mostly in Q1 at McDonald's which is huge. And that's a really really big deal. Lot of Big Macs in that in that win, but well done to John Jason, and really, that whole team who've been leading us well out there for a long time.
On the kind of returning to the office question in front, we don't yet know when we'll be back in the office in kind of a more normal way, and what that will look like, but it won't be January. And so I got a question about that in a new criterion lunch this week and just wanted to let everybody know it will not be January. My best guess. It'll be late spring early summer, but we don't know is the short version of that and we will be reaching out for some one on one calls. There's a six of us actually who will be making those calls to the whole company.
Julie sometime between now and the end of the year to talk through that with you a bit understand your own kind of personal preferences and concerns, and there's no pressure whatsoever on that, by the way, to like there's no right or wrong answer to it, and but also to ask some questions and understand how you're doing and if there's anything you need to make your work from home situation more comfortable or more productive that we can help you with. Today, since we know that we're going to be in this state for a bit longer.
Let's see impact shout outs. We have two this week we have Arthur Patch Atura from Emily Crawford who said that Arthur on the wild Type client project has been incredible and specifically knows the product there inside and out. And so because of that product knowledge, kind of in a technical BA role has helped really enable and equip the rest of the team to be their absolute best and so way to go Arthur, Emily. Emily knows good when she sees it and it's great to hear the impact that you're making there.
Secondly, then Melissa Arteaga and this was from Jim, Cody and Amanda Leachman who mentioned that Melissa just organized the end of Task Order Task order being an army term for sort of the big statement of work or big engagement for the year. The budgeted engagement for the year.
And they had an in depth ask order party last Friday. You know teams party. That apparently was a ton of fun and really funny and very very well done. So great job Melissa. Creating good cultural moment in a good fun moment in this virtual environment and they really wanted to say hats off to the whole Army team for completing that. So that was 39 weeks long. 39 deliverables, hundreds of standups, thousands of hours of teams, meetings and really made a remarkable impact on Army's ability to recruit candidates and the modernization of their marketing and recruiting function.
Which most importantly helps line up qualified candidates with great careers and job skills that are really good fit for them and so big high impact thing from the Critera Army team there. So that's it for this week. I hope everyone has a great weekend. Get some rest and we will see you next week. Thank you.
