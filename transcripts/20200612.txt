Hey Cordair family happy Friday I wanted to give you a quick update today on a few different things on specifically talk a bit about Juneteenth and some things that were going around that that I'm encouraged by give you some broad business updates for us just in terms of how we're doing from a company health standpoint. Talk about recent wins from this week, will talk about just kind of an update on reentry planning and what we're thinking about their cover.

Quick update on the UK acquisition that we've shared many times before and then Lastly wrap up with our impact awards. So, regarding Juneteenth, an email that John Wren sent last night and then the email that I sent earlier today, you know generally continue to be encouraged by the peaceful protests and just the amount of appropriate attention at this topic is getting right now in the United States. And really around the world, and believe that if we continue that up.

And to keep the focus on it that we can in fact get positive lasting systemic change that spend much needed for a long time. But this could be the time.

But I sent in the email earlier is that we are going to be recognizing Juneteenth this year as a day off really meant for the purpose of reflecting and engaging on this particular topic. And I sent the mechanics in email of how to do that and how to how that will actually work from a meeting standpoint and from a petyo standpoint, that sort of thing, couple of other things that I'm excited to announce where as Critera doing a donation matching.

Program effective immediately and where will match up to $15,000 for any any cause or charity or organization that you choose to give to that's related to this topic of Black Lives Matter, and specifically how we continue to help stop racism in the United States. Anything related to that topic of your choosing. You donate to what you choose. Send us in your receipt or sort of proof of that.

And at the end of six weeks, Critter is going to make a matching contribution up to the amount that we collect during that time. Our donation is going to go to a kind of a stem focused organization that's targeted at helping African American and other underrepresented minorities from an educational standpoint, specifically in the field of STEM. We felt like that lined up really nicely with our kind of business and what we do.

And is a great way to help that next generation of young people coming up through the ranks. And so I'm really excited about that. And we've set up a mailbox. Donations at critera.com I believe is what it is, and so I'm sorry. Contributions at critter.com so will send that out in an email, but contributions at critter.com is the name of the inbox that you can send us. Your proof of donation.

That's one thing. On a similar note and we were actually already already planning to do this this year anyways, but it's related, but really excited that for the first time ever for us we are specifically doing campus recruiting at historically black college and universities, and so we'll do that this fall. Again, that's not directly related to it's not in response to this, but I thought it would be important to share that. That is something we had already planned to do and will do.

Next week you will also get some email announcements from our diversity and Inclusion Committee with some additional resources and events and activities that you can participate in or use really as a way to kind of guide some of your reflections next Friday or just in general as you want to learn more and get more involved. So again, continue to let's let's all continue to talk and really develop that empathy and see what we can do to make positive lasting change.

As far as business updates, our business is really healthy right now and continue to be encouraged by the progress we've made this year. From what you know, what? What happened in mid March early April to now? It's really remarkable that we're really looking at the first half of the year, where it will have actually grown the business. Something like 10% year over year, which is honestly just remarkable in a global pandemic, an economic meltdown. And so I want to say thank you to all of you. I really do believe it's purely a result of.

The grit, determination and and camaraderie and hard work that we've all put into this together and so thank you for that. It's an amazing outcome and a real tribute to you.

Let's see. So when's this week? We have two that are noteworthy one at C Spire, which is a 10 year plus long client. But this is really the first time that we've ever sold into the Chief Marketing Officer, and even something that the CEO is personally involved with. So congratulations to that team. So that's GAIL Marissa Mathews. Mixu filled Lockhart and a whole team of others who made major contributions to that, but helped us get that strategically important win at one of our longest standing.

That kind of flywheel, big clients so great work to that team and then also want to congratulate our whole team. Phil Lockhart and Crew who worked on the Toyota pitch that's been officially one and will be working with wrap there on kind of the program on Boarding setup, program management, type role starting next week so that big win. Therefore Omni common for rappan for Cordero as well in terms of another meaningful kind of win heading into the back half of the year here.

So a couple of wins that I wanted to point out there on.

Every entry plan update, really nothing has fundamentally changed with any of that. You know, I sent an email.

Yes, earlier this week, but mentioning that we're extending our or maybe I mentioned it last week at all, but we're extending our primarily work from home as the norm until at least the end of July. Potentially longer is what it what it looks like at this point, but you know, so want to encourage everyone to continue to work remotely and stay safe. If you do need to work in the office. So if you have a situation at your home or apartment or whatever that makes that difficult, just do let us know. We have people who are working in the Dallas Office now to small.

Very small number, but they're doing so safely and effectively, and that is an option for you if that's something that you want and need, so feel free to reach out there really encouraged. Still with the progress towards the London and UK based acquisition that we've talked about many times, that's progressing very nicely and looks looks to be set pretty close to the end of the month. To get that closed. Just really excited about you all being to meet their leaders and team and vice versa.

More broadly, because they're great group of people that I feel like we'll be great culture fit in great culture enhancement for us as well as just giving us that international geographic reach and some of the kind of service extensions and capabilities that they bring that are an extension of what we have at cordera today. So that's the update on the acquisition. And then Lastly wanted to recognize Anna Corey Johnson primarily for the impact for her participation last week in that the panel that we facilitated.

And really sharing her her story and her experiences in a very vulnerable, vulnerable and helpful way. Though in terms of helping us all better understand different backgrounds and have more empathy and really understand why it's important that we be involved in this in this cause and also to Sarah Bruna and Alex more for their leadership in terms of pulling that event often the planning and the ideas and the work that went into helping us get the right panelists identified and be prepared to have a great.

Great panel that I think was really high impact, so thank you. Thank you all three for that and the impact you made on our culture and our people as we move through that last last couple of points, I'll make you know it's summertime. It's a different kind of summer that we're dealing with, but it is important that we all make sure we're making some time for PT. Oh, the more you can plan that in advance, the more helpful it is to us in terms of knowing about it. So think about when you're going to get some time off and.

You work with your project teams or your corporate team leads, but also submit those requests in so that we can make sure we have good visibility into when that's happening so we can plan accordingly. Hope everyone has a really Good Friday afternoon and a great weekend and will talk to you next week. Thank you.
