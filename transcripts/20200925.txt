Happy Friday to you as be a quick update today but just want to give you a few updates on how the business is doing. Overall, it's been a really good week. Another good week for Cordera and quick shout out. Thanks for trying for doing the update last week. Did a great job with that and appreciate the partners helping on that and also given criterion the chance to get to know more of the partner team. That's really the purpose for that Ann's. Overall business is really really healthy. Continued to for one just make a big impact on our clients and that continues to kind of pay through too.

New opportunities that are existing clients and incremental new wins at new clients too. So really really healthy healthy business overall. Right now. Campus recruiting is in full swing. Thanks everyone's efforts really making that excellent in a very strange year for campus recruiting were not on site. You know at career fairs and that sort of thing, but her excellent feedback from our Baylor team in terms of from some of the professors there and the team that are virtual career fair in activities were by far the best and.

Really well recognized there and then also really wanted to celebrate. We have our first ever campus hire from Prairie View A&M so are historically black colleges and universities. Effort there and we've already gotten our first tier so outstanding news and great job to that team to help us with the campus creating of more diverse candidates to bring them to the firm. So really excited about that.

Wanted to just give a quick plug to track stars so our new CPM and performance tool and really career development career coaching tool. So just a couple stacks for you. They've already been 272 feedback request completed so the career coaches send those requests out to people that they're minty or coach. He has been working with to get that feedback. I've completed two of them myself, so I'm contributing to the cause here, but.

Really do encourage you know when you get those, make sure you spend it. Only takes a couple of minutes but give that quick feedback. It really is helpful to people to be able to develop and helpful to the coaches to know where they need to help help there person. Also in there been 475 new goals that have been set up where you can put your career goals in there and then work with your coach to help realize those goals and wanted to give just a quick update on what we're kind of calling new normal and what I mean by that is really I think kind of post pandemic. What is life at?

Here look like I'm working. Look like specifically sharing this now, even though we're a ways away from any sort of return to new normal just so that as you're having conversations with any campus candidates, you sort of know how to message it. And you know, I think the best thing we can do right now is.

Share that we're going to continue to evaluate what's going on in the world, both from certainly from the virus itself, but even just post virus our post pandemic.

Valuate what our clients are doing in terms of you know. Do they want people back on site in the office? Do they have some expectation for some travel? What are people want and need? And we know that there's a pretty wide spectrum. There are people who are very eager to get back in the office every day and we already have certain people who are working in the offices again and others who are way less comfortable with that or just prefer a working remotely kind of lifestyle. And so we'll continue to evaluate what's best for our people and what's best for our clients. But I think it's fair to expect and communicate to any candidates that.

We're anticipating increased flexibility in the future from a you know where you work, type of thing, knowing that there will likely be times most people need to be onsite, and there will likely be more flexibility though than what we had in February. So that's the best way to communicate that for now. And just, you know, I think it's fair to tell any candidate that we're taking a very progressive and open minded stance. Really looking at what's best for our people and our clients in our culture and will continue to kind of evaluate that as we get into winter and spring next year.

And communicate as anything becomes more solidified or concrete will have some upcoming low meeting days that you'll see put on your calendars. Those are meant to help us all from a kind of mental health standpoint in just a physical health and rest and recovery standpoint. At most of them will be on Fridays, but where we we block the day off and we're really encouraging. Unless you have a critical client meeting that you need to have to not have meetings those days and that way you can still work and catch up on what you need to do, but do so in a way where you're not on.

Teams calls all day and where you can hopefully even maybe knock off a little early and get an early start on the weekend type of thing. So encourage everyone to really respect those. We will have the day off on 11. Three for everyone to have an opportunity to go vote in the US and so really do encourage everyone to go participate in that an let your voice be heard type of thing. So let's see here number of new wins. This week we had a big win at Brinker.

More at home advisor new wins again at Orthofix, which is great to see them kind of coming back. Genentech, an employee bridge. So fantastic job at all those clients. Continuing to sell work for Q4 and on into Q1. Also wanted to just quickly celebrate how well the integration with in collaboration with BMW, our colleagues in the UK has been going.

Start a sort of what we call first post acquisition collaboration called this morning an extremely encouraging news where we're selling work and being able to use some of their resources to liberate Unilever and then they have a number of different clients. BP down in Houston. Walgreens Boots Alliance and several others. Principality bank and others where they're bringing us in and really leveraging some of our capabilities that.

Either geographically like the BP deal or in some cases our E Commerce and digital capabilities that they don't have as much depth in right now, and so it's just it's such good proof points that not only culturally and just the great people that they have, but the actual business fit has proven to be quite good in the early a couple of months here, so extremely pleased with that. I have three different kind of shout out groups here that I wanted to recognize. So J Hoover wanted to recognize Dana Smith, Jake, Mr Shaun Borders Rouge, Menasha.

In Michael group for their work with OPC and Rice Pride, again efforts to help us recruit it. More diverse, diverse team and also just help those students with their interview prep and there really career prep. So great job to that team and then also to make some Everett Accounting and to Jay for their work with tech digital core which is helping to build websites for LGB T plus organizations around the world as and they're doing this just as a volunteer thing on the side.

And so well done to that group to to to really help in our communities and help people who need it. Jeff Hewitt wanted to make sure and recognize Levi Fuller for his cross practice in Geo work to build new campus technical training camp start. Technical Training, said Levi has been doing a great job with that and really delivering an excellent training product that our new hires will be able to leverage and then also to Rick Gibson for his work in addition to his client leadership roles in.

I'm really helping Jeff with practice leadership into Microsoft Solutions practice with staffing with recruiting, he said rick's been doing a great job there, so thank you Rick and great job. And then last gym. Natalini wanted to make sure and recognize Sean McCullough, Christian Guajardo and Bernard von tipo have on the HomeAdvisor nice NICE system integration said. They've been going really above and Beyond and making sure that that successful in delivering an excellent outcome for the client and really making a big impact there so, so great job to that team altogether.
