Hi Chris family, welcome to this week's edition of our Friday video. Today is the JV update version of the team is going to be no inspiring views. No inspirational Wallcoverings team still is on back order, and Captain Andrew is on PT. O today, you know, for those who don't know me, my name is Kevin Erickson. I'm a managing partner in the firm. I've been here for just over nine years in my primary job is helping people grow.
In and really specifically, it's done in a couple of areas. I had the privilege to be able to lead our Denver team unfortunately have to do that from Dallas, but do the best they can but have an amazing team out there. Led by Amanda and Brad and Garrison. And as we've seen and grow that office or the last couple of years, and specifically we had a chance to celebrate this week, our first $1,000,000 month. And so we had a chance to do that last night. And also 43% of the office is brand new since the start of the year, so lots of change and growth in that environment.
You also continued to be able to play with in MC. You know that's been the area that I've played for most of my time in the firm and my job today is primarily to stay out of Christine's wig, so I help encourage her and really helped guide and lead the senior team there earlier this year took over a role in operations and play a variety of different hats, working with more leading the team there and then. Lastly, I may have a chance to serve on several of our large accounts, particularly. The HomeAdvisor and Angie Home services team, where we've had an amazing run led by Jordan Powell and a lot of other leaders or the last couple of years so.

Her last couple months is that's growing very snippily, so that is a little bit on me. Today's updates are pretty straightforward, so some of the same themes that we've seen over the last few, but we'll start with just some quickly. Quick as business updates. So today is the last business day of the month. We are in position to have another record setting month if things work as planned will be over $10,000,000, which will be the second month in a row that we've achieved $1,000,000 milestone overall for Q4 things look really strong. I think we will exceed expectations, will be working through the planning for the rest of the year.

Over the next couple of weeks, but are really well positioned to come in really close or above our overall plan and may have a sneaky position that will be right under. Maybe Justin's goal of 100 million and you know one of the focus that we're working with today and I'm really our teams and OSC is to build our January backlog so we do have a drop between December and January. Most of that's just because of the change in quarter when we work with those I slices. We expect to have very good sales, but we do want to close that business over the next three to four weeks.

And another interesting milestone this week is that we exceeded the 500 headcount in the US, and so we started the year somewhere around the 330 people and so represents about 35% growth and suggested amazing feat in my opinion about how we've grown and added so many people. While we've been primarily work from home.

Hey.

Gee.

I.

Aggies.

You're moving on. We continue to work through. See the way NZ have celebrated them over the last few months and the updates, and I think that hurt a lot of those brands. But we continue to see great momentum. We sold over 2.8 million dollars in the past week at a list of new and existing clients want to call out? Just sorry so 2.8 million 10 clients over 16 opportunities, so seeing lots of good effort to mix appliance mix of opportunities both in terms of strategic work that will likely lead to longer term strategy deal or what.

Imitation deals and also just the normal implementation work. That is been the bread and butter for years. For our firm. I didn't want to call 3 opportunities in teams. The first is Exxon Mobil, just being led by Kevin McDonald, Aaron Grossinger, and Lauren Hamilton. Yeah, that team has been working for the last few months really all over the world over the nights and lights and weekends trying to be able to grow that account. And we're starting to see it will pollution to the fruits of their labor and have a nice pipeline for the next year and want to think that team and really excited to see what will do with that.

Count similarly on McDonald's? Yeah, Jason and John and the other members of the team have been leading that the last couple of years and really been positioning us for what we think will be in 21. A chance for McDonald's to be our largest account. You know there is potential for over 100 some resources on that deal. There's a several $1,000,000 that have been one recently and we're going to really continue to expand next year. We're taking away from two of our larger competitors there. And Lastly, I want to call it a new logo. United healthcare. So this is a logo that we've been working for over 2 years too.

Have an opportunity to serve them and we we were awarded work this week around UX and conversion optimization. So I want to think period and the team there for winning that efforts and hopefully that will extend to a new work in a longer term relationship with them.

Bye.

Aggies.

Please.

Yeah, so as we you know many, many times will help but call out specific individual individuals and impacts. And I want to put my own spin out this week. So instead of an individual people, I want to call it several areas that folks that I'm just very thankful for for all the work and effort that you're doing. So first of all I want to call out all the individuals who have worked on large pursuits that failed. We celebrate the the ones that win. We just did that a second ago, but I think that what I love about our Kodera team is the effort that we put into all pursuits and particularly the large deals like WBA that take.

Weeks and months of effort and don't come out the way we want. Has one encourage you and thank you for all that effort and know that those lessons that we learn in those pursuits we use in pursue for future pursuits and it's not lost work. But yet I know it doesn't feel that way because we tend to always celebrate the victories.

Similarly, I want to thank the practising judo leaders. I want to thank you for all your efforts at during this time of kovid to help us with connectivity work with onboarding. Really trying to make sure that all the criteria people are known and have the ability to feel like they can experience the cultural norms and values to why we all excited to be here. And I think as we continue to move forward through these uncertain times, know that we have to continue to make sure to find new and unique ways to connect and to really put people into that so we can understand what it means to be a criteria. How do we grow and expand and how we do it so rapidly.

I also want to thank young team members in our corporate teams working across all the different functions and everything that you do to make delivery possible. For those that are in the delivery side of the organization, we couldn't do our work with what happens within finance with HR talent in the operations team.

And you know the two last ones. One quickly is around, goes back into practice in Julie's, but it's one of the staffing process as we move over 500 people $10,000,000 a month continues to be a challenging, and there's a lot of elements and people across the practicing Jews at different degrees that are helping with that as we want to thank you for everything that you're doing to make sure that we can have this match between what are whatever employee expectations in deeds are. But our client needs to be able to do that on time, and it's not. It's not easy, you know. We're working through some improvements in systems and processes to make that easier, but definitely.

Acknowledge how much energy and effort goes into the staffing process on a daily basis. And Lastly, I want to thank all the developers, Baas, PMS and leaders that are on large accounts. You know, the criteria is grown primarily through our ability to do great work and have that continue at longstanding client relationships. That often means that we ask our teams to stick around and stay working within those teams and build a shared that domain and technical knowledge. And oftentimes people want to do something else and experience something new, and they have to have that choice. I just wanted to say how much I appreciate.

Everyone who decides to stay and work through that and continues to become the reasons why our clients asked us to stick around.

Hey.

Hey.

You'll Lastly I wanna just a closing shouldn't give a couple housekeeping items so it's the last day of the month your checkins are due today, so everyone please before you leave, go in and submit your monthly form to your coach and then coach. They argue your octobers snapshots are reviews. Excuse me or do on November 1st which is Sunday so hopefully you can either get those done today or early next week but please work through that process. 'cause until that is submitted for October we can't begin in November.

And then also I want to encourage all our coaches to be thinking about the snapshots that are due in December. Yes, so the feedback that you request in your November forms as you really be that any outstanding pieces of information that you're looking for so you can fill out that. Overall, you know that six month feedback and Lastly one encourage everyone is asked to provide feedback. Please be willing to dive into some critical feedback. I've seen a lot of examples both in the my particular teammates that I coach and others where they get a lot of great positive feedback. But the constructive feedback is a little bit lacking.

She has to talk about the snapshots will be available on November 16th, Monday, November 16th. There is training for coaches, two sessions that week and they are due on Friday the 4th. So please be thinking about how you're going to capture and get those done. Get any information you need and please try to do that. Not during Thanksgiving week. If you're anything like me, you'll pretend that you're going to do all that work while you're off that week, and nothing gets done any of its back into the last few days of the third, 4th, and Lastly on. This open enrollment does begin. Also on Wednesday, November 4th and so.

There was an email that was sent out this week introducing you to the My benefits microsite. You can get more information there. There's also been four sessions that were scheduled for you to attend if you choose to, and then those changes will be made through bswift.

And so we have six weeks, four weeks left of the year. I want to encourage you to get some rest on the weekends. Be able to work hard during those weeks and so we can get to the Thanksgiving holiday and year end Holidays in a way that gives us time and effort to be able to be refreshed. You know. Lastly, just remember to vote if you have not done so already, and I hope everyone has a healthy, safe and happy Halloween. See everyone.
