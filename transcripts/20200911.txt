Hey Cordera family happy Friday to you.

Actually bringing this video to you from a house on the coast of Maine in a pretty secluded area town called Sullivan and came out here last night and my family and I are spending the next nine or so days here exploring and hiking and relaxing and recharging and really look forward that won't be working much at all next week and really, just wanted to take a moment to encourage everyone to make sure. If you haven't already done so.

To book an plan and take some petio this fall to make sure you'd recharge, you know, everybody's been working hard this year. It's been a challenging year on many, many fronts, and you need to make sure you're taking the appropriate time to rest and recharge. And re energize yourselves, so please do that. So next week on that note will have a new guest partner presenting the weekly update for you, so you'll have to wait and see who that is. But excited to enjoy hearing Andrews.

Talk last week I thought he did a great job. Super Funny set, a pretty high bar and so for the rest of us. So we'll keep mixing in others from the partner team as throughout the years.

Early this morning today, you know it's September 11th. Ann woke up this morning was just reflecting a bit on September 11, 2001. So 19 years ago and the terrorist attack on the United States an you know what a scary moment or series of moments and days that was for us as a country. But really the thing that came to mind for me was how in the aftermath of all that, how well the American people came together.

And we're unified. And just, you know, kind of contrasting that to the current division that exists in the country around politics and the election. Anreis an been just really, really proud of the people of Critera for throughout this this difficult year difficult season.

Our unified we've been as a people and as as a firm, you know, even though I know we don't all agree on on some of those same topics. And really on any number of different things. And that's OK. That's good. In fact, like that's part of the benefit and the purpose of diversity is having different points of view, different experiences, different backgrounds, but still being able to respect and love each other. And so my hope is that we can continue to be a good example of what that looks like in the country and in the world more broadly.

You know that was really the point of the Critera listens series that we just wrapped up the kind of 1st installment of the first 5 episodes of where we really just look to listen and learn from other people and try to develop more empathy and understanding. And at least I found when I do that you know it's so much easier to like other people love other people. And as Andrew Warden has said, it's hard to hate up close, you know, and I think that's wise words and so it would encourage if you haven't watched those.

They've been recorded in somehow. Please do I think they're quite good and very thankful for all the panelists who helped us out with those. So as far as you know, kind of business updates and the rest of the normal stuff. So on the business update front. Really, really strong performance across the board right now. So I mean honestly the healthiest the firm has ever been in the at least 16 years that I've been here in terms of really, really good August that we wrapped up September is going to be another record breaking month.

And in October, should surpass that if everything kind of comes in as planned and we've got a nice sales pipeline in through to the end of the year, and so really healthy state. Right now we're continuing to hire as really as fast as we can find. Great people who are a great culture, fit, or culture enhancing to the business and so please keep the referrals coming into the town acquisition team. Make yourself available to help with interviews, both campus interviews as well as experienced hire interviews as appropriate. And let's keep up the good momentum on all fronts there.

We had four new wins that I'm not aware of this week. At first financial at Genentech at Exxon Mobil and then, oh, giant extension of the team at C Spire. So well done to those four client teams and everyone who worked on that. And then there were three.

Three impact encounter shout outs that I received this week, but it really all three of them really cool so Taylor Marley is wanted to give recognition to Jolene Smith, who's been working on the AT&T video business that we just won this summer and started. Jolin is a new campus, hired in an internship with this last year, but in just a short amount of time has helped. Kind of wrangle a very complex marketing and advertising program.

You know, get to kind of a standardized program, status cadence, an report structure as well as do a quick vendor selection so very very high impact in a short amount of time in a really complex environment. So, well done, Jolin. Keep up the good work there. Raul wanted to celebrate Allison Kingsley for her work on the Nielsen program. Specifically, said she's been making just a really high impact to that clients business into the program success, and also just fully embodies.

All of the critical core values, so great job Allison. Well done and then John Jacobs and Jason Goth wanted to recognize Daniel, Yeoman for his work on McDonald's. They just they highlighted the complexity of that program having to really manage and deal with the three headed monster that is McDonald's critera an Capgemini. But Daniel's been doing that with excellence and justice, leading a really complex and sophisticated program with great results. So great job, Daniel.

So that's really it for today. Another great week for Critera and just again Challenge Challenge everybody. Be kind people show respect and let's continue to try to get more unified not just as a company but as a country in his world. I hope you all have a great weekend. I'm going to be out of pocket nearly all of next week, but look forward to seeing you after that. Thanks everyone.
