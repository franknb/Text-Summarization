Hey Cordera family happy Friday to you.

Can this be a real short update today? Just give you the kind of quick headlines lead by just saying I was out most of this week on Vacation and Carl and I, my wife and I had a chance to get away for a few days together and it was great time to just kind of step away from the business and step away from our kids too and get some time away. Which was fun. So really would encourage everyone if you haven't, make sure you're planning in breaks for yourself, whether you choose to go somewhere or not. Important to get those those breaks away from work.

We need him to recharge, you know, so make sure you're doing that. So really just overall updates. Business is really healthy and strong that continues to be true. We exceeded our July plan that we had put together. We are on track to have an even better August and September as we look at those two months. And so you know, healthy forecast, healthy sales pipeline, plenty of new business opportunities, both truly new clients to us as well as.

Some of our existing clients and most of our existing clients remain extremely healthy. We're very much actively hiring and have been for several weeks, and so make sure you're sending in referral spring of your friends or people you've worked with in the past past. People you in school with whatever but who you think would be great fits here at grid area and you can not only help us on that front but earn a referral bonus as well. When we hire those people and that's our best source of candidates is when they referred from someone who's already at Grid, Aaron. Those the culture knows what we care about from a.

Talent and kind of caliber character as well and so just please keep those coming to us.

There's, let's see one. Several wins that I wanted to point out this week, so we won new work at Mars at Qantas at Triumph and at Unilever and Unilever is interesting, in particular because it's our first opportunity to actually staff that partially with some of our new team mates from BMW from the UK, and so really, really fast to get to a proof point that we can be Better Together by. This wouldn't have been an easy thing for us to staff before and we were able to.

Leverage the fact that they're in the UK and the client is is partially there and so really cool opportunity to get there quickly and start to work with our new friends and colleagues from the UK.

On the DMW node I had a chance to catch up with Chris, their CEO this morning and their business doing really, really well. Also they also beat their July plan and have strong looking forecast and pipeline for August, September and on into the fall in the October November timeframe. They've won several new pieces of business and have several other large opportunities on the table, so just across across both parts of the company, really strong performance and their people have also.

I'd say settled into the news quite well of the acquisition and becoming part of Critera and so on. All fronts really, really doing well on that.

Will be a really good session next week that Andrew Warden and the marketing team are hosting regarding the Critter rebrand and I would strongly encourage you to participate in that. Listen and learn about it. Teams done an incredible job of really thinking through the critera Brandon how it needs to evolve and change and that's both from the way it looks on the website and on our presentation materials. But also some of the words that we use to describe it and I really think it will connect and support sort of the modern version of critera.

And the mission that we have to really make an oversized impact on our people on our clients and on the communities that we live and work in and so excited to see the rest of that. Excited for you to get a chance to see it and then we can all start using it. So don't make sure you don't miss that. Today is the last day for our interns that joined us for this summer. I want to thank them for joining us in all the great work that they did this summer and also think the rest of the folks at criteria who really helped give the interns an incredible experience. I had a chance to talk to.

A couple of different groups of the intern team, right right at the end of the summer, one group just yesterday and the other a few days ago and just got a chance to ask them what their experience was like and heard some awesome stories about how much they learned how much their mentors and onboarding peers and career counselors just supported them and jumped in to help them and care about them. And so it was really a good representation of critera and so thank you all of you who participated in that and investing your time and energy with them.

Last thing I'll do is just wrap up wonder, share a story from the partner team call. We had this morning as we were going around the horn. Kind of in Scrum style. Each person giving an update.

I observed and I pointed out to the team that really just about everyone of us when we gave our update on what's on our plate, what we're working on, client things, internal things in almost every single case, each person was talking about how they were collaborating with and working with one of the other Critter partners.

You know it was. It was so encouraging just to hear how common that was amongst our team. An how in every case it was like a positive experience. So I brought Vincent in and he helped with this. I brought Phil who helped with this. I partnered together with GAIL and we went after this. You know, to hear those stories.

It's for those of you who've never been in other consulting firms. It's not common for that to be true. You know, typically partners. I'd say our best case, pretty siloed like pretty independent in terms of how a consulting partner would work. And worst case can be like a negative form of competitiveness where you're actually sabotaging each other and competing in negative ways. And it's just so refreshing and unusual. Honestly, that's true at Criterion that's deeply ingrained in our culture, and a byproduct of the culture.

And again, it's part of the secret sauce, and so I just wanted to share that story that I really do believe that that type of collaboration and care for each other goes top to bottom throughout the organization and we need to make sure we always keep that. So thank you for your part in that and justice. Again. Thanks for everything else you're doing right now. It's a fun season for us. Here at credera. Make sure you take care of yourself and again, take some breaks and schedule in some vacation. Otherwise have a great weekend and we'll see you next week, thanks.
