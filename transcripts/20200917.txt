Hello Cordera family trendsetting here coming to you from my Home Office in Frisco, TX.

And I'm really excited to be able to bring you this week's company update. JB mentioned before that some of us would be filling in for him from time to time to hopefully create a free space in his schedule. So hopefully we're doing that today. JB, you may have seen Andrew a couple of weeks ago, whom I was incredibly impressed by, and I was even more impressed when I found out that his whole opening bit only took him 17 takes. Amazing. Just kidding. I'm sure he probably nailed it on his first take. But anyway, I know there's a ton of new people out there that I may have not met, so.

Just a little bit about me. I'm a managing partner with the firm and as crazy as it sounds, 'cause I've been here nearly 14 years. And so I have seen a lot of change over that time. But in all seriousness, as I thought about giving today's update, there is just so much to be thankful for and so much just to be really excited about South. Want to talk about that a little bit? First of all, just amazing that in such a difficult year we can be so unbelievably healthy.

If you look back to March, there's no way I would have bet on us being in this position in September, and it may sound like a broken record, but.

When all of this craziness began and we had the lockdown, you all just didn't miss a beat. You kept cranking. Now BD cycles. You kept cranking out amazing deliverables for our clients. You kept recruiting amazing talent. Even if we weren't going to hire them that day. And so I'm just amazed by that where you could have been scared or gotten down with such uncertainty of knowing where is the firm going to be? Where is the country going to be worse? The world going to be? You shove that all aside.

And you represented maybe our most important core value, which is humility. You put our clients and you put our coworkers first, which is just amazing. So well done to you and it's put us in what I would call a very surprising state. And so you've heard that we had record revenue in August and you may even heard that we're actually probably going to beat it in September and a crazy year like this again. Just unheard of and so just a quick update to year to date. We're actually.

On plan from a revenue perspective and a good bit ahead from a profit perspective and so with all that data earlier this week, I was actually wondering. Well, OK, that's great with weather. The storm so far. But what does the rest of the year look like? And so I went out and compared our forecast for the rest of the year to what it looked like on this exact date last year. And if you look at September, October, November and December on average revenue wise, the forecast for those months is 35%.

Ahead of where it was this time last year, so we're in an amazing spot so I just couldn't imagine being here. But a few updates I want to give you today. The first is around campus hiring, and so while we're still welcoming campus hires from the last semester, we've actually kicked off our campus hiring efforts for this semester. And we're already drumming up just a ton of interest. And so I wanted to thank everyone that's involved in those efforts. I know we've all got day jobs, and you're all just incredibly busy.

But you're doing an amazing job generating interest in our firm, going out and interviewing and qualifying candidates and answering their questions of what it would be like to join Cordera and so thank you for all those efforts were a couple of weeks in. I think we've got about six more weeks to go. So again, thank you for all of that work. And then while we're spinning up our campus recruiting cycle for this semester, we've still got another class or another crop to come through here, and I think just over a week.

We've got another group of about 14 folks that's going to be joining us so I would encourage you to reach out to those people. Those new hires and make them feel at home, let them feel Chris Culture and know that they can reach out to you in return, and ask you questions at anytime and if you're on a project that you think is a good candidate for a new campus hire work with your project director work with your oh. I see and go get one or 2 or 10 of those new campus hires and so anyway, just just super excited about.

The recruits that are going to be joining us than a week and all of those that have already started. This is the cream of the crop across several campuses, and that's what's going to fuel that amazing growth growth that I know that we're going to have in the future. Few quick updates on areas that I'm fairly close to. 1st. First off, I wanted to talk a little bit about the build centers. Gary Ferris has done a great job in leading that practice in its first year of existence this year. He's currently focused on further defining our build center service offering so that the rest of the management team

understands when and how to position our build centers to help us go after new work. He's also leading us in a study of velocity to understand. OK, if we do bring the build center in for a new perspective, a new or current client, what does that look like from a velocity perspective? Sure, it's a lower rate, but should I expect lower returns? An early innings are actually pretty compelling from a velocity perspective and will share the full results when they come out here soon.

From a critical health perspective, Sema has been doing an amazing job leading that practice in the firm, which is actually our first formal industry practice. If you like and for those that don't know, it's actually a joint venture between Critera and Omnicom Health Group going under the brand of Critera health and so we did some calculations earlier this week and we're forecasting our overall health care revenue to grow from 2019 to 2020.

By 70% so just amazing. It's obviously a really hot industry that just isn't going anywhere and we're going to continue our efforts to double down on those.

Alright, from a weekly wind perspective, we've got several more. Again this week. I know shocking Toyota Abilene Christian University in RG Orthofix and then multiple wins at JB Hunt.

And then I cannot forget the one that some are calling a colossal win at C Spire, to the tune of about 2.9 million dollars. So great job, my Choo, Jeff Briggs, GAIL and the rest of the C Spire team. So just a ton of more wins this week. Just amazing.

And then maybe the most fun piece of these updates, and probably the most important piece is our impact shout outs. And we've got a couple of those today, the first of which is Chelsea Klein from Simon. So J. Simon Says one of our recent projects, Chelsea Klein, quietly automated post deployment smoke tests on our clients APIs to validate everything was working correctly after deployment. These caught the attention of one of their lead enterprise architects who was very impressed and commented to other directores.

Quote Check this out post deployment smoked wrist tests in prod are so pretty close quote. Sorry if I didn't do that justice. The tests also caught some bad data that had made its way through to production and allow the team to fix it before it caused any harm. So great work Chelsea. Amazing stuff and Simon. Thank you for sharing and then our second one is Luke Hamilton from Sandra Kirby Baker, Ann Gary Farris, Sandra rights.

I'd like to recognize Luke Hamilton for his hard work and tenacity as he created a presentation outlining our engineering offerings for our partners at BMW. He worked closely with Jason, Gary and me, and in the process of creating a deck to educate BMW sales function on eight of our service offerings he collaborated with and coordinated across a couple of dozen Quedara team members. He put a significant amount of effort and dedication into this initiative in as well deserving of a virtual Pat on the back.

Look, there is your virtual Pat on the back. Great work, obviously super important helping BMW get ramped up and that's an incredibly important topic that you were helping us with. Two so Luke and Chelsea. Amazing job. Keep up the great work and so team that is our update for this week. Again. I'm just so excited and thankful for the efforts of each and everyone of you. Just know that we are truly making an extraordinary impact on our clients.

On our communities in on each other so have a great weekend and I hope you can enjoy some downtime. Thank you.
