Also have a few really exciting mid year promotions to announce. So as you all know who've been here awhile mid year promotions are not very normal. We are main promotion cycle is associated with our fiscal year end which is in the with the calendar year. So at the end of December but there were a few people who really stood out and who were extremely close to promotion at the end of the year last year and we had we had spoken with each of these people to say, you know, you're really really close. We just want to see a little more time or a little bit more.

You know development or keep in some cases keep doing what you're doing in a slightly different context and so excited to be able to announce these mid year promotions that were effective at the midyear point for us. So July 1st, so we have a list of Grayson as and these are all promotions from consultant to senior consultant. So Alissa Grayson, Devin Leisure, Libby Schultz, Brooke strodel.

Justin Bevolo Michael mcrorie

and then we have one consultant from senior consultant, one. I'm sorry one promotion from senior consultant to architect which is Matt Shepherd so congratz to that whole group. Incredible group of people really really stand out and you have just been performing well the entire time you've been with the firm and excited to have you as newly minted senior consultants. So congratulations to that group and make sure you reach out and congratulate them if you can.

We'll go through like we typically do in the in the normal fireside, so a quick review of financials. So this is through June and so through the midyear point and you can see here the month of June, so really through for the year of 2020, I mean incredible performance. I mentioned this every week in my my updates, but given global pandemic especially, even forget that it's just a really strong year of performance and so you can see how the metrics track here in terms of headcount were effectively right on plan.

Even with the pause that we had in our hiring back in March in April, in May, we've resumed hiring and we're really right. Tracking, along with our plan there from a utilization standpoint, we're actually a slightly up revenue, is just slightly down. The reason for that is primarily we did some discounting during the real worst of cobit, as it so far for our business in terms of where we were seeing really negative impact back in March, April. May we discounted with some clients to make sure we kept their business overall and got some of that revenue.

And that makes it where our revenue is little down, even though utilization is a bit up. Typically that would be the opposite.

Our cost of goods sold is pretty close to where it's supposed to be, just slightly higher gross margin then it you know. So that's just revenue minus cost of goods sold is about a million below plan, but our SG and a so our sales general administrative expenses. So I think our our office rents an what we would typically use on entertainment and travel and things of that nature. Plus our corporate staff. The expense of our corporate staff is what's in SG and a an at substantially lower than normal because no one can travel.

Not doing much entertaining and so that number is naturally suppressed there, and so the result of all that is that our earnings are actually up, which is which is incredible for this year and is meaningful because it allows us to do things like fund the bonus pool for our management team and that sort of thing. So All in all, financial performance has been extremely strong and just thank you for all of your efforts in that it is, it's honestly incredible, and it's impressive to do so given the economic climate this year.

And the headwinds that we were facing in the spring.

Last thing, just a few other updates that I'll hit on quickly, so we had several more really good wins this week at Orthofix. More at home advisor. More at C Spire and more at NRG. So HomeAdvisor ceasefire energy continue to be really, really strong. Performing accounts, forests, and in those teams are doing a great job.
