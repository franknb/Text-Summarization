Hey Cordera family happy Friday now I know what you're thinking you're thinking where's Justin? He's the one I like the best he's my favorite. Well, he's my favorite too, but sometimes the hardest working man in show business just needs a break and today is one of those days and as he mentioned, every now and again we're probably going to have a different voice. Different person. Do the credera update and today you have me. So I captain Andrew Ordon will be your pilot on today's weekly update Journey, so.

Fasten your seatbelts, bring your tray tables and seatbacks to their full upright and locked position. And let's do this. Got a lot of updates today for you will cover a quick recap on business updates and weekly wins. A few tool and process milestones that occur this week and will wrap up with some impact story. So on the business update front, we had the All Hands meeting yesterday. If you didn't get a chance to watch that or attendant live, I highly recommend you go back and look at the video.

Justin sent the link out in an email yesterday. In it we got a chance to meet the executive team from DMW.

Love seeing them and listening to them introduce themselves. You get just a sense for who they are as leaders there. So sharp they are so humble. Such low ego people and you saw some of that drive. British British humor in there an every time I'm around them every time I'm around anybody I've met at BMW, they're just such great people so I know they're looking forward to getting to know you and your get looking forward to getting to know them. But it was great to be introduced.

To them, yesterday we also had about 25 campus hires starting this Monday. As Justin mentioned, some of the name pronunciations were hard, but what was cool about seeing all those faces was just the amount of diversity that you see just in background in schools and justice. Love seeing all the new people coming into our company and just the diverse backgrounds that we're seeing in our higher so excited about that as Justin mentioned.

August was an outstanding month for us. We wrap that up on Monday, record breaking month on both revenue and profits.

And JB says this all the time. I want to echo it as well. Incredibly proud of the work that each and everyone of you were doing. We had an incredible summer from a business results standpoint. We also did a lot internally and I know each and everyone of you were working hard and justice. Really proud of how we're performing, what all we're accomplishing together during this pandemic. So way to go on that September. October is shaping up to be great months as well. From a business standpoint and a forecast standpoint.

It's also the time of year that while we're bringing in the campus, recruits from last summer, we're also gearing up for a virtual campus recruiting effort this fall. So get involved. September and October will be busy months on those fronts as well. Several wins that we had this week to go through several different wins and projects at home advisor, including a really big one.

Lily was a win this week. Red lobster. Leslie's pools container store really cool to be back out there. Invitation homes. BG staffing. Alteryx Orthofix Nielson big team extension out there an OMG also a record forecast entry for the Army. 29,000 hours went into the forecast tool this week so I think that's a that's a record on a singular.

Forecast tool entry. So way to go Army team A few milestones and emails that you received this week. Trakstar went live. It's our new tool for managing the CPM process. So great work by our CPM committee. They've been hard work on replacing the sum total tool with some changes to the overall CPM process. How we do monthly chat, monthly checkins, so really excited about that portal. Our portal got a haircut too.

It looks really, really slick. A lot of great information out there, including new information about the service area, so you can get more information and how we articulate and tell our story about strategy, transformation, data and technology, and all the 23 service area offerings underneath it and so great work. Big shout out to the teams that worked on those.

For impact awards, we have two this week. The first one is Bobby Pennington and this is from Jordan Powell and he says, you know, HomeAdvisor had a PM go on maternity leave earlier than expected. Bobby stepped in temporarily filling the gap while maintaining his full-time role, running a handy product team stepped into doing 2 full time jobs right now, and all the hours and effort that requires while we staff and train a replacement and so way to go, Bobby really appreciate the effort on that way to make an impact on our clients.

The second one is from Jim Cody, and she'd like to recognize Shelby struggle and less artega Allen Hangon and Keely Hagen Buck for their hard work, dedication and patience to implement the Pegasus system for the USUS Army marketing ecosystem. I think I'm saying that right, maybe piga sounds complicated and I'm sure they did an amazing job. Jin says they had some pretty significant headwinds working with that services team.

But they did an amazing job on it. So way to go to Shelby, Melissa Allen and Keeley and finally Labor Day weekend. We're heading into a long weekend. I hope each and everyone of you gets a chance to get some rest as the great fictional character Jack Reacher often says, sleep is a weapon and I hope all of you get a little bit of that this weekend and just get some much needed rest. So with that, the captain has turned off the seat belt sign.

You're free to mill about the cabin. As always. Any feedback, criticism, or requests send to scovingtonacroteria.com have a great weekend and will talk to you soon.
