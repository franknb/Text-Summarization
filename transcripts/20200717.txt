Hey Cordair family happy Friday to you. Really glad to be giving you a quick update today. Having another great week at the company and some exciting news to share as well as one pretty big update and so wanted to run through these things. So from a business health standpoint we're in great shape. In the month of July it's really set to be at this point a probably a record month all the way around. High utilization, great revenue and profitability.

And continue to SAP. Tremendous success in win rate on some pretty interesting and big pieces of business and so extremely well done across the board by the team and our leaders. And everyone who's been supporting those efforts.

In particular, this week we got pretty big wins at wild type in RG Echelon Fitness. Want teava Ann? I think there are some others that I that I haven't included there. But really big week there and really strong sales pipeline. Looking forward because of that's enabled us to do something that was really fun, which is to actually reach back out to all of our campus hires that are supposed to start this fall and offer them the opportunity if they wanted to to start either one or two months early.

And that message has been extremely well received. There. Very thankful for that opportunity to very happy about it. They are in the process of letting us know which ones are going to move forward, but I think we already. As of last night had something along the lines of 70% of them who were choosing to move forward their date. So what that will mean is we will begin to have some. Some new campus hires joining us at the end of this month. So right at the end of July, which is super exciting and always good for our business and the culture to get that.

New new energy in the building in new talent in the building, so to speak, and so really encouraged by that. That was a fun thing for us to be able to do. And it's really a direct result of all the work that you all have been doing during this season to really help from, you know the troubles we had back in mid March and April to just rebuild an incredibly solid business that's strong and healthy and moving forward. So great work there. Second thing, I wanted to talk about, which is also exciting and big and good news is we now officially have a date locked in for the closing on the London acquisition and that.

Is a week from Monday or the 27th, so you'll see more on that and will have all hands meeting on that same day where I'll describe a bit more about the specifics of the company and talk through any questions that you might have about that but encouraged by that and excited that we kind of got what we needed to from the UK tax approval that I mentioned, we've been waiting on and now we've got that lined up, so barring any unforeseen challenges, we should get that closed out a week from Monday.

Let's see one update that I wanted to share here and then there will be an email that goes out that we wanted to provide some clarity. So we're coming up on what we had extended our work from home.

Time frame to be and we made the decision to go ahead and extend that significantly to the at least the end of the year, and so really expect that there's not anything that's going to be fundamentally different with the virus or the safe and safety and health of our people between right now, and sometime this fall, and so went ahead just to try to give clarity for folks so that you can make plans, especially those who have kids in school, and your options that you're trying to decide right now and how school is going to look for you this full.

I wanted to go ahead and give you that certainty on what it's going to look like. I do want to remind everyone that you do have the option to request access to the office if you'd like to work from there, and so just just follow that process of requesting access. We review those as of right now, we only have about 2% of the whole company who have chosen to do that, but we've approved everyone who's requested it to this point. So let us know if that's something you're interested in doing or need to do, whether it be for a day because you've got something going on at your house or apartment or longer term.

And will review that and get get with you to help you get that worked out. An know that this season of life that we're in and this whole year quite frankly since the spring has been very challenging on a number of different fronts. So for some, the news that we're going to be continued in work from Home mode is probably quite challenging, and I just really want to encourage you to. As I mentioned last week in my update as well, like reach out to us if you're struggling in any way with that and let you know reach out to Stephanie Miller.

Miller and her team. They're the right point of contact. You can certainly talk though to your PD or oh, I see your practice leader, your Geo lead. Any of those people would be happy to talk with you and really just listen and try to see how we can help you get you connected to the right resources. Or just get you connected back into the company if you need. If you're feeling disconnected somehow, so please do reach out and let us know and we'll do the best we can to help you with that.

Let's see, one quick reminder is the last week of our matching program for the Black Girls Code. Based on the any donations that you make that help diverse people or under represented people in any way specifically around kind of the Black Lives Matter movement. But it can be outside of that category if you have something else you're passionate about, make your contribution. Send us in your receipt and we'll make sure we make a matching contribution on your behalf. Then two Black girls code.

Last thing is, we've got a really cool upcoming series of roundtables really around the topic of privilege, and so invite everyone to join me in those and check out this really great video that the team put together and then have a great weekend. Thanks everyone.
