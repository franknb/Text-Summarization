Hey Cordera family, very happy Friday to you wanted to provide you with some really exciting news and updates. Today, in addition to just the normal updates for the week, so I'll start out with just the kind of normal updates and then get to some exciting news and announcements. So first, just health of the business is remarkably strong right now.

And in July and then looking forward into August in September and into the fall. Which then you have just really high demand for what we do, which will lead to obviously very good utilization and good revenue and good profitability. So in really terrific shape all the way around, continue to have great success in new business development and winning winning sales cycles that I'll share a bit of news about some recent wins in a second, but just health of the business, super duper strong and it's really in complete thanks to the work that you all do everyday and the impact that you're making on our clients businesses.

And that they see that and that their feeling that impact, because obviously not all companies are doing well right now.

But the work that we're doing in the quality and excellence is really ringing through there. So thank you for that commitment and what you continue to do. Some wins from this week. There are quite a few, so I'll rattle through these really big verbal win at AT&T on some work that we've been we've been working on for about six or seven weeks now. SL or invitation homes. More work at Exxon Mobil. Cool new digital menu win at Brinker. Quick trip. JB Hunt large engagement with Toyota and then.

The HomeAdvisor team continues to kill it and more new wins there in that account this week. So really robust set of wins. Some of those are pretty sizable efforts, and those are helping fuel kind of long-term forecast that we have, which is great to have. It gives us that security and ability to kind of hire and grow around that, and so we are continuing to really hire as many great people as we can find. And so Alex sent the note the other day. But if you have referrals for people you think would be great at criteria, please send those to our talent acquisition team.

In addition to the experienced hire recruiting, we do have campus hires that are beginning to start at on Monday, will have 11 that of our new campus hires that start, and it's always fun, fresh faces, fresh energy that they bring in a lot of a lot of talented young individuals as well. And so these are some of the folks who were able to take us up on the opportunity to pull their start dates back forward when we were able to offer that to them, and so that we have 11 starting Monday, make them feel welcome. They'll be going through their critera you and on boarding process, but it won't be long before there.

Start to get mixed into your teams and working with you and so please give them a warm welcome.

The big announcement for today, though I've been I've been talking about this for what feels like years, but it has been months of talking about the London based firm that we've been talking about from an acquisition standpoint. Well, the good news is officially, as of this morning that signing is complete an closed. It'll officially the press releases and announcements will come on Monday morning and then we'll have our all hands Fireside Chat Monday afternoon around 1:00 o'clock. I think central that.

I'll give you all the details about who they are, exactly, you know and really run you through what clients they work with. What type of service is bit more about their leaders and people and culture, but I just I honestly couldn't be more excited about it. It's something we've been working on for a long time. Scott Covington is let us extremely well from a kind of deal pursuit standpoint, an I think we just we found a very very criteria like object out in the world that happened to be in a market that we really wanted to get to in London and.

That gives us access to obviously the UK, but really all of Europe in a more meaningful way, and I think it's just going to create positive opportunities around all around for the firm and for our people.

And they're just such a good fit. Any of an enhancement of our culture. So excited about that I'm glad we were able to get it done, and that's that's knocked out. Lastly, I just want to share a little story I participated in.

Panel event last night on racism in America is great panel is it was all centered around a Harvard Business School case study that was written not long ago. An lot of ever like 60 different people that participated in it and we discuss different topics related to that. And there was there was one guy in particular that shared a story that really connected with me. So this was a black man, probably in his 50s. I would guess. Maybe that maybe upper 40s but.

You told the story about how he was a he dropped out of school in the ninth grade. He ended up going to prison for four years when he was a young man and now he's built a very successful barbershop business an but the thing that he said, you know, when we were talking about like what can we do, basically, to positively impact systemic racism and some of the challenges associated with that in our country, an.

I wrote this down. His quote was I just tried to make a positive impact on at least one person every day an influence the way that they think about race and racism in a positive direction. And the thing I like so much about that is it can feel really daunting sometimes to think about transformation in general, which we do with our clients all the time. But when you think about like solving a big problem like that in a country of our size, it's daunting and it's hard to know like what can I possibly do to help with that? And I just found his his comment very encouraging because it's.

It's actually doable, like you can commit to doing that everyday. Is trying to make a positive impact on somebody. I also loved it 'cause it uses the same word that we use in our binocular, around impact. And so anyway it connected with me. It was motivating for me and hopefully it will be for you in some way.

That's really it for the week. Again, another really really strong week for us as a company. Tremendously thankful for what each of you do every day and every week to help us make that impact on our clients. And it really more than anything, the way the way you do it, you know, kind of the way you treat other people and really let our values shine through. So thank you for that. Have a great weekend and will talk to you on Monday.
