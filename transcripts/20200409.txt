Anchor Dairy family happy Thursday. Full disclosure. I just recorded what I thought was a pretty good version of this, only to find out that my phone had stopped recording. About 2/3 of the way through so we get to do it again. And the unfortunate thing is, I mean, it was like Jeff cries at Kevin King Catherine brochure. Level quality of comedy an unfortunately very little chance that I live up to that this round, but will give it a shot. So wrapping up the 4th week.

Of work from Home Era and wanted to do weekly update. I'll have some general business, you know how we're doing as well as share a couple of really encouraging stories of how we're helping our clients.

Paying their businesses, but then in particular in these, how that's then making an impact on our communities that we live and work in. And those are great stories that I'm happy to share with you.

Before I jump into some of those things, I did want to share that for myself. Some of the rest of our partner in leadership, team, HR, Anar, corporate operations teams. We all observe that and we're talking about earlier this week about noticing that from the criterions we've been talking to this week more people than the past three weeks are experiencing some anxiety or angst, or even just cabin fever. And so if you are feeling that way this week, I would just want you to know you're definitely not alone. And I think we're all probably grappling a bit with.

You know how long is this going to go on water? All the impact is going to be and more and more criterions are beginning to see impacts that hit a little closer to home. In terms of people that they know people in their families who are either negatively impacted from actual health issues or or job and employment type issues. And so it's the severity of the reality of it is kind of sinking in a little bit. If you are feeling that way, I would just encourage you to utilize some of the resources that we have available to us and so we're sending out some tips and tricks.

But also reach out to Stephanie Miller or anyone on RH our team to you know. Just just get the appropriate help that you need there and that's that way. You can make sure you take care of yourself throughout this challenging season.

From an overall health of the business standpoint mentioned last week, but we wrapped up March and really Q1 and in terrific shape that had a really good quarter. April is currently forecasted at 70% utilization so just general parameters. We plan at about 75% typically utilization in a normal month. From this point we would still pick up several points of utilization so you would say we're right about normal, maybe just a pointer to behind where we'd like to be at this time.

So I'm like, OK, OK shape not great but but certainly not bad shape for April. May is currently forecasted 57%, which is actually several points ahead of where we were same day last year. So if you look here on April 8th or whatever day it is 2019 and you look at what is was may utilization, it was a few points below what we're projecting right now. So again OK, good shape. But obviously expecting it to be more challenging to sell new where.

In the current economic climate than it was this time last year. All that being said, and it will get to some of the wins and opportunities later. But we are still having success in terms of and I've been super happy with the teams just just grid and scrappiness in terms of figuring out ways to go work with our clients. And when you work even in this climate you will. I want to share one thing, roll openly and transparently with you so that you really hear it from me first. I do expect it will begin to hear that some of.

The other Omnicom agencies, so not critera, but some of the other agencies are will begin to do layoffs or reductions in force or furloughs potentially as soon as even next week. And I don't have any specific information about that yet, but I do expect to see that and I wanted you to hear it from me so that you really treat myself and the other critera leaders as your source of the truth for some of these things as they begin to unfold versus the rumor mill or whatever. And so I don't know if that will come or be mentioned in.

And like John Renz email updates or or just more hear chatter through the network of other agencies that you may work with, but I wanted to share with you. I do expect to see that and so don't be surprised when you do see it. At this point. You know prayer is not considering a layoff. It's not part of our plan. We're continuing to run and operate our business and try to sell as much to work as possible to maintain a healthy status. And that's the way we're going for now.

You know the main point I wanted to make today in terms of like just what I want to highlight is, I'm going to talk about two clients specifically where the work that we've been doing with those clients is now enabling them to make a big impact on the community, which is super important at the moment, and so Chili's is the first one. So they've been a great client for six or seven years now. We've built their complete digital channel and really helped with all of their online ordering to go.

And now door dash and delivery type of options so you know. Obviously restaurant industry massive impacts, you know going from for them having a good year where they were ahead of plan to having to shut down all the dining rooms in a very short amount of time. The real only saving grace in all of that is their very flexible digital platform and online channel that we built for them. That's that's doubled in terms of sales during this kovid time and now represents about 35%.

Of the total sales from a year ago for the same time frame, and so it's that revenue specifically from that Channel that's allowing them to unlike many of their competitors, not do a furlough right now, or a reduction in force for their their workforce, and that you think about the impact to the Community. You know, some of their competitors, furloughed hundreds of thousands of employees, that for them not to have to do that yet, and they've committed to at least not doing it through the end of June is a massive impact on the communities that we live and work in the United States.

Where they operate globally.

Huge credit to our Chili's team for the work that we've done to help them. Second one highlight is JB Hunt. JB Hunt said trucking and shipping logistics provider. Not always the sexiest thing necessarily, but in a time like this you really get to see the importance of those players that are that are key to the supply chain and really the infrastructure of the country in the world. JB Hunt being being key in that you know the work that our team has been doing there over the last couple of years has all been around modernizing their technology, architecture and infrastructure.

For a lot of their operational systems, and so think about how they're able to continue to operate efficiently and effectively during this time. Handle the volumes and scale that their handling is in large part due to the work that our team has done to help them build that robust infrastructure and technology architecture and systems.

Only really need that that JB Hunt got an opportunity to do this week and is there's a proposal out really associated with FEMA and the task force that the President of the United States put together to look at it. Supply chain partners to try to help with really. The national supply chain right now. An JB Hunt was able to turn around a proposal for that in under 48 hours and so we'll find out soon if they won that work, which would be a huge contract in win for them.

But again, just an interesting opportunity. That was the specific teams that we work with that had chance to do that proposal. So two stories there will have more in subsequent updates. So of how we continue to make an impact on our clients and in our communities and on each other. Obviously wanted to highlight then a few of our business development wins and sales cycle opportunities right now. So several wins in the last week we had wins at Leslie Pool at Leslie Pools Mercy.

Mobile US Army and then we have some very high probability opportunities at Anna when it day behind. Sorry and some very high probability opportunities with HomeAdvisor Brinker. Volkswagen Additional Army opportunities, and then some of these down here are not quite as high probability yet. Butter, butter interesting, and and I'll highlight a couple of them so perinatal access and Highland Park Presbyterian Church. I wanted to talk about those two in particular because.

They really represent kind of what we've been calling Junkyard dogma. Junkyard dogma means we're all trying to pitch in with whatever types of opportunities we can find that are beneficial to those clients. Like, really, do help their businesses or organizations. They may not be necessary. These huge multimillion dollar engagements or anything like that. But they represent really good work for us to do that are helpful to those clients. And in these times where there's not as much demand and not as many of the really big deals, those take on heightened importance.

Shelby struggle in particular when her for sourcing the Highland Park Presbyterian Church opportunity and helping work with davido bat and some others on our team to put that proposal in response together so well done Shelby others. I'll mention. Washington Speakers Bureau is a website re platform opportunity Andrews Distributing as a strategy project and then there are opportunities at Freedompay Echelon Fitness Cavender's which is actually a past client of ours from.

Academy, let's move it over to Cavender's. Reach out to Kevin McDonald and good opportunity there. Texas Farm Bureau Globe Caribbean Development Bank and there are others. You know. We continue to find.

Find new opportunities and that's been really encouraging, as we've seen.

You know the first 2 weeks of work from home and as the US economy kind of started shutting down, we had a lot of client attrition and clients pausing work and pulling hours and dollars out of our forecast over the last really week and a half, we've seen that stabilized quite a lot, where less is being pulled out and we're starting to add more back in. And so we're going to continue to work hard to maintain that momentum. Build that. So just to wrap up for today and for this week.

You know, fundamentally believe, like I mentioned last week, that this season is going to be defined by grit and Scrappiness, and I feel like we're really well positioned for that. It's right. It's kind of in the DNA of cardera an also believe that will be better and stronger as we as we emerge from this because we've gone through it together and will have higher trust in each other, higher confidence and just deeper relationships because of it. So thank you for everything that you're doing.

For those who are celebrating Easter happy Easter this weekend on Sunday and I hope everyone takes some good down time, that's important that we actually do. Like I mentioned that we draw those lines between the week and the weekend in the day and the night and those sorts of things to make sure that while we're in this unusual season, you're still getting plenty of rest and having fun. So have a great weekend. Will see you next week.
