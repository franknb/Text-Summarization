Hey Cordair family happy Friday to you for general updates on state of the business for this week. Please just watch the Fireside Chat video for Wednesday. If you weren't able to attend that live, but I did want to share an important announcement in terms of a decision that I and the rest of the partner team have made regarding our internship program for this summer as well as the planned campus start dates that we have coming in over the summer. So we've decided specifically to take two actions. The first is to cancel our formal paid.

Internship for this summer and instead offer each of those interns there about 30 in total full time jobs for once for post graduation. And for those that are having opportunity to do a second internship because they're younger that they would get from us. An internship offer for next summer. That's the first step. The second is to push back the start dates for all of our plans. Summer campus hires by two months. I'll offer some more details on both of those in just a second, but first I wanted to explain.

Why we're taking these actions now? So as I explained in Wednesday's fireside chat.

Our business is currently facing 33 realities. The first is that in March second half of March and early April as a direct result of the coronavirus and global kind of economic shutdown.

Negatively impacted our business to the tune of about $6,000,000 of missed revenue opportunity there. We are also then finding that winning new business in this climate is possible but it's slower than normal and we've had some good success is there but we are seeing slower velocity to win new work and then Lastly just the overall economic data that you've. I'm sure all seen shows that for the back half of the spring and really throughout the summer likely to be a very challenging.

Overall economic environment. So because of those things we feel like it's important that we continue to control the cost structure of critera to make sure that we're able to keep the team intact and come out the other side of this an even stronger position.

So important to acknowledge that this is not an additional escalation from what I communicated on Wednesday. The plans for this were already in the works just before that, but we wanted to be sure and do a few things first. First, we were making sure we understood exactly what our communication plan was, an exactly what we were offering to the interns and campus full-time hires before we communicated more broadly. But most importantly, we wanted to be able to communicate with those students directly first before they hear it through some sort of Grapevine or from a friend type of thing, and so.

All of those calls to the interns and campus hires are underway right now, probably as you're watching this video.

And so now I'll share just a few specific details on each. So for the interns, it's approximately 30 students that we had planned to come in for the summer.

An what we're notifying them of is that all of them all 30, will receive either a full time offer for employment with criteria for post graduation or a secondary internship next summer. If they're not graduating between now and next May.

And they have the course of the summer from a timeline to evaluate that option before it expires, and so they can they have till the end of August to decide if they want to take that offer or if they want to pursue something different. There were also then offering them two different choices, and neither of these choices their offers are not contingent on either of these choices. They can choose either of these or nothing at all. The first is an alternative unpaid internship. If they just want to get the experience of working at cordera and working in consulting.

And we would work. It was most likely at least start out virtual and then we'll see if we're back in an environment where we can get them into the offices and do a more normal experience. So that's option one. Option. Two is a Critera leadership development program like a. We're thinking of three or four day experience that would happen in early August where the interns would have a chance to come in and spend some time with critter leaders and work through some programming. We would put together on.

Certain leadership development principles. Again, it's just a way to get an alternative experience to what they would have gained during their internship that at this point we're not able to offer them.

Again, the offers that we're making to them for them for full time employment or not, contingent upon which of those opportunities they take advantage of, or if they choose to not do anything with us this summer, they'll still get the offer from us to again. The intent behind that is twofold. One, we don't want to be anymore disruptive to the early part of their career. Then we absolutely have to. And 2nd, we believe strongly that by that point our business will will have recovered and rebounded, and we will absolutely be back in the hiring mode of.

Wanting that next generation of great talent to join the business, so that's what we're doing with the interns.

For the full time hires, we're talking about approximately 60 students that would have been joining our business sometime between the end of June and the early fall, and we're pushing back the start dates for all of those different classes by two months. And so if you would have started in late June, we're moving those out to late August and the rest will follow in that in that same pattern, we believe that two month push gives us enough time to absorb the economic impacts.

And to really start to rebuild the pipeline around that so that we're ready to have a new set of talent and that we can handle that additional cost structure at that point.

So just to kind of closeout on this, I want to emphasize a few important points. Confidentiality on this announcement is extremely important. You know, we trust you as professionals and we trust you as part of the creator family, and it's important that you keep this confidential and I specifically. What I mean is, it's important that each of the students that's directly impacted by this has an opportunity to hear directly from one of the leaders of critera instead of hearing it through some sort of a Grapevine of communications and so.

We're we're getting all of those communications done by Monday. Most of them will happen by today, but by Monday at the latest, I'll let you know once those have been done in case there are people you need to reach out to, but let us handle those communications in the appropriate way before you try to reach out to anybody that maybe a friend or someone that you know that's impacted by that.

You know, again? Want to reiterate, we have no further escalations planned. There's nothing else that's in the works in terms of what I announced Wednesday. In terms of my pay cut and these two changes to our internship and campus programs, we believe that those are the right actions and the only actions required for right now and will continue to communicate transparently as we move forward if anything changes with that. But for now, just know that there are no more planned escalations on that.

We made this decision very, very clearly to help preserve the Critera team and make sure that we're able to come through this successfully and became quite strong. It's a difficult decision. It weighs extremely heavy on me and the rest of the criteria leaders who made it because these are real human beings. On the other side and you know I can relate very much to this situation. When I was first coming out of college it was right just before and right during thenthe.com bubble burst in September 11th, 2001.

And the recession that followed. And the uncertainty in the anxiety that that causes really for everyone, but especially as you're just entering your career, is quite impactful. And so you know, we have a tremendous amount of weight associated with making a decision like this. But we do it ultimately because we feel like it's the right thing to do for critera and the people of Critera to do that.

We're also aware that there are many other consulting firms and other companies and industry better taking similar or even more severe action, and so that weighs heavily as well on just this generation of young people who are trying to enter the workforce, and we ultimately fuel for them and have a tremendous amount of empathy for what they're experiencing. During this time, we're going to do the best we can to help help each one of those young people be successful, even find new opportunities over the summer for the interns were trying to connect them with some of our clients that are in.

Staffing industries and that sort of thing so that they have an opportunity to earn some income over the summer. Wrap up by just thanking you for all that you do. Continue to be extremely impressed by the just excellence and work ethic and grit and determination that the criteria team shows. 3 three very quick examples that I want to share with you that have happened all within the last really 24 hours that are awesome. First is.

We want a new project with a company called Mortgage Connect this week and kicked it off yesterday morning and Kristian Bush, Ellen and Luke Wilson. Or are the team for that. And I was so impressed in this kickoff call with people that they've never met and they were not able to get together with in person just how much drive and initiative they immediately showed to get off to a great start there with super impressive. I want to celebrate the team that's been working on the Porsche sales cycle.

That's Clint Griffith, Christian buechele. Again Sandra and Ryan Chin Day in the last two weeks pulled off just an awesome effort working with two of our sister agencies over in Germany. TL, Gigi and Smart Digital to take the lead on this massive RFT response and it was incredibly well done and again, they're working with people they've never met before across many, many time zones. Anna Multi can't can't.

Away and just delivered with absolute excellence and so proud of that team. And then Lastly, I want to highlight something just from this morning with Josh Phillip. We had a update call on Invitation Homes and I love this expression. He said he's he's working side by side with this kind of contract project manager that the client has brought in and his point, he said. Well, I'm just going to have to prove that I can outperform an artwork that person and I just love that sentiment. That's absolutely the heartbeat of criteria and the.

The real grit and determination that we need from everyone right now. So thank you Josh for that.

You know, I'll say this. Like I said last week, I strongly believe will be better, Better Together. Having gone through this and I've never been more bullish on the long term trajectory of credera. So thanks again for everything that you do. Have a great weekend and we'll see you next week.
