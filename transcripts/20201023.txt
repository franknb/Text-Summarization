Hey critter family. Happy Friday to you. I'm enjoying some nice cool weather here in the Dallas area today and just want to give you a quick update. You're stuck with me for today, so no none of the funny bits like we enjoyed last week with Kevin and Vincent. That was hilarious. If you haven't watched that one, make sure you check it out and will have other partners and other leaders who who bring you some of these future updates as well. But for today it's just me so this will be really quick and easy one. So overall our business continues to be.

Extremely healthy, you know. October will be record breaking month from a revenue and profitability standpoint and we're looking great now through the end of the year we really have been focused on for the next 4 weeks. So between now and the week of Thanksgiving really continuing to push filling up the quarter one so January, February and March kind of sold work so that we're really able to take great downtime and get some much deserved rest and relaxation.

Over the Holidays of Thanksgiving and Christmas and New Years and all that in December and so kind of 1 final push here and then, hopefully we can all get some good downtime. One thing I wanted to talk about. Purchased a minute today is something that's been really fun for me this week. It had a lot of opportunities to do some really senior level recruiting and I've always said this is true about campus recruiting. When you do that, it really makes you re learn what you appreciate about Critera and the work that you do. At least it always has for me.

Because you're describing it to these young people, and I've been doing really senior level, so kind of principle and partner level recruiting a lot recently and have been having a great time with those conversations and the thing that was that's so encouraging is our message of what we're doing, what we're building, the vision of the global Boutique, and the impact statements that you've all heard me say many times by now are really connecting and working with these really really talented senior people, and in a way that I personally haven't seen that connect before and so.

Really encouraged by that and will have some some high quality new leaders joining the firm. I believe in the coming weeks and months as a result of that which will be great for people and great for the business overall.

New ends this week. We had at McDonald's HomeAdvisor, an employ bridge, so three of our really great client teams, and kudos to all the work that you all were doing there to drive that, but those are all big wins for us that really carried through Q4 and into Q1. The shout out or Impact award and recognition this week goes to Emily Crawford, who Trent Sutton wanted to recognize for her incredible leadership on the wild Type client project, where you just mentioned that it's exceptionally complex.

Project and has very complicated set of stakeholders to really manage and engage and lead on that work, and that Emily's been doing it with complete excellence an demonstrates or humility by always putting the client's needs ahead of her own, but really just kind of living out the critical core values and doing a great job on that work. So well done Emily. Kudos to you, that's it for this week. So easy quick update not brought to you by any other client, sponsors or anything else unfortunately, but will look forward to talking in next week. Have a great weekend everyone.

Thank you.
