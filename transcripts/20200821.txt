Hey Cordair family happy Friday to you personally, very thankful it's Friday. It's been a great but kind of long week and I'm tired and ready for a break. And so I'm going to knock off a bit early this afternoon but do want to wish you all happy Friday and Happy Weekend. Another really good week at Credera. We continue to stack good ones together at this point which is really fun and encouraging businesses really healthy overall so will finish August well ahead of our submitted forecast last month and at what should what should be a.

A record breaking month for us as a company. So thank you for all your efforts that go into that. It's really just continued impact on our clients business that we make across many, many clients. I think we have something like 75 or so active clients at the moment and all those teams performing well and with excellence. We've got great new campus hires have come in recently and more who are coming into the business soon. That's great, brings energy, brings new bright young people who can help with the work.

Just as a reminder on that front, make sure you're reaching out to those people getting to know them. Obviously while working remotely right now makes that more challenging than when we're in the offices. So just make sure you make some effort to connect with those people. If you have needs on some of your project teams or internal initiatives that you could use some help with and make sure you're connecting with practice leads to practice leaders and their staffing people to get those folks tagged into your teams.

You know, on that same note on campus recruiting, the campus recruiting season starts soon. While this fall will no doubt be different in terms of the way we have to go about it, we're still excited and we have ambitious goals for the number of new candidates that we will look to talk with and bring into the firm. And so just know that that's coming soon. More information to come from the team that runs campus recruiting for us across the board, but look forward to your participation in that that fun event that's important to us.

Some wins from this weekend last since last week. Really, all I did is kind of a sentimental update about how it was my favorite week of all time, so some wins during that time. HomeAdvisor and Handy had more wins. That team continues to do extremely well. The Omnicom Media Group gotta Win, which is great within the within the network there employbridge additional Win Valley leadership, Weight Watchers and C Spire, so some great wins over the last two weeks. And there's a tremendous amount of sales pipeline and strong work.

Which is important as we as we look into Q4 of this year and then and turn the corner into 2021. So right now just outlook wise. September really really strong. We show some availability starting in Q4 which is natural and fully expect those to be healthy months in a healthy quarter as well. We had a chance to.

Post and facilitate another criteria listens panel earlier this week. If you weren't able to attend live, we will be sending out that the recording of it so that you can watch that highly encourage it again. We were fortunate to have five incredible panelists leaders who joined us and really just shared their experience. I've personally loved facilitating that series, even though they're quite difficult actually to facilitate for me. For one, it's challenging to facilitate period. I would say just because you have to be.

Really paying attention and then kind of you know, past the Mike passed the ball to the right person at the right time, but obviously this is a topic area around race and racism and anti racism and ally ship that can be hard to talk about sometimes. But I actually think that's that's why it's so important that we're doing it so that we all get more comfortable talking about things that are uncomfortable. And I know that's been in my own personal experience and I've valued that and learn from it.

Next, next just quick topic. I wanted to bring up, but you know, in many parts of the country this is back to school week. I know for a lot of us in Texas it is.

For those of us with children, it adds a degree of difficulty for sure, you know this this year is unlike any other I've ever experienced in terms of what that looks like.

Where every family in America with kids is basically like their own. IT support helpdesk and really trying to get their kids squared away. And I know for us it's been a bit of a mess but just want to really encourage all of our parents to step back a little. And if you need to balance your workload a bit while you're getting your kids squared away, feel the freedom and flexibility to do that and then for everybody else. Just be mindful of the fact that any of the working parents on your team.

Now we're just the parents on your team, period are.

Are are dealing with, you know, an unusual set of circumstances, not just for work, but at home too, and have a bit of Grace Ann and know that their schedule may need to flex a little bit. You might reach out even and see if the scrum times another kind of rituals that the team is using still work. Now that we're in school mode and where many many people have children schooling from home at the moment at least temporarily, couple of shout outs in terms of criterions, who are making huge impacts on the Furman on their clients? So first.

For the Exxon Mobil team, that's specifically Lauren Hamilton, Allie Buckmaster and J Hoover. Kevin McDonald wanted to make sure you got a shout out to really celebrate the work you've been doing on that Salesforce Pardot Road map and enablement for Exxon Mobil.

You know everything I've heard that team is killing it. There's a. There's a degree of challenge on it in terms of the work is with Asia Pacific and specifically Singapore. And so there's a 13 hour time zone difference between US and then in the central zone, and so makes that challenging. That team's been working some odd evening hours. We really appreciate you doing that. And then the other second part, I say is you have my commitment in our commitment that that's not going to become the norm for critera.

But it is an important. This is a wall work. We need to breakthrough at Exxon and quite honestly, potentially in that region. But we're not planning to become a 24/7 shop where you have to work crazy hours so, but we appreciate the effort while you do that and just the excellence which have been representing us. And then, Secondly, Taylor Marley, and wanted to make sure we recognize Gabriela Bciu to. Hopefully I said that right, Gabriela, apologize if I didn't call you Gabriella, be next time. But she jumped in to help with our.

Volkswagen pursuit, and even though she's she's fully booked in billable right now, we needed some help and she created an incredible deliverable or proposal for us around media in housing that was extremely useful for Jason got an auto include and what we're what we're proposing forward, so really appreciate that effort and the great work you put into that look. I'll wrap it up here. Another good week at Credera Fun Week. Exciting things going going on across the board and.

Continue to be thankful for the opportunity to work with you all and lead here and hope you have a great weekend, thanks.
